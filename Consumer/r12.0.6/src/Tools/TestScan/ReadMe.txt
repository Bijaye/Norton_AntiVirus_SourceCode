TestScan command line parameters (if you do not enter any then it will just load the scanner and initialize it):
/UseDec - uses decomposers
/UseThreatCat - turns on non-viral threat scanning
/Mem - turns on memory scanning
/BR - turns on boot record and MBR scanning

Anything with no "/" in front of it will be added to the list of items to scan...if the path has spaces you must enter quotes around the path.
