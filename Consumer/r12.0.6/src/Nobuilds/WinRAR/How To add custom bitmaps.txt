How can I add a custom BMP file to SFX module? 	

It is allowed to edit Windows resources contained in SFX modules to adapt them for your needs. For example, you may wish to add bitmaps to the start dialog. 

SFX modules are compressed by UPX tool, so you need their original non-compressed versions to edit resources, which are present here, in the archive UnpSFX.rar. 

WinRAR does not provide tools or documentation for modifying resources. It is rather complicated process and if you wish to do so, you must already have a resource editor and you must know how to work with it. But you do not need to edit resources if the standard SFX start dialog is acceptable for you.

COMMAND-LINE for UPX

upx -9 -k -onav.sfx uncompressed.sfx
