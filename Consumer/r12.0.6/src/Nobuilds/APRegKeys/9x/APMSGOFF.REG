// This file restores Norton AntiVirus Auto-Protect to its default behavior.
//
// When you import this file into your registry, the Auto-Protect message
// displayed during shutdown is disabled. This will avoid a problem with
// some video drivers where the system appears to hang during shutdown.
// Your floppy drives are still scanned for viruses if Norton AntiVirus 
// is configured to do so.
// Import APMSGON.REG into your registry to re-enable the message.
//
// You must restart Windows for this change to take effect.
