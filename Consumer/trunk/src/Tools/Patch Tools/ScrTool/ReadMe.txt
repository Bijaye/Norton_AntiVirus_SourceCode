       WIN32 APPLICATION : ScrTool - This tool was created for the
       Espana patch and will update the help files for NAV depending
       on if the build is a ScriptBlocking build or a non-ScriptBlocking
       build of NAV 2002.  It will also change the LU product name for
       non-Script Blocking builds of NAV to "NAVXX NoScrBlock" so future
       patches can distinguish non-SB builds from SB builds.  This tool
       is not used for the NAV Pro patch since there are no OEM or
       non-SB builds of NAV Pro.  The tool also correctly updates the
       support.hlp file for OEM and non-OEM builds of NAV.
