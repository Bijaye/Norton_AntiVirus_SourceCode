What is this?
This tool is usually used to look for hanging ccApp problems. By launching each plug-in in it's own copy of ccApp we can tell which plug-in is causing the problem.

Instructions for using the ccApp plug-in isolator for NAV (and NIS).

Install procedures:
1. Copy the "ccApp plugin isolator" folder to the Desktop or other conveinient location.

2. Run "_ccApp maker.bat". This will create copies of ccApp.exe with an appended name of the plug-in it will host.

Note: You might have to manually edit the batch files if the install directory isn't "c:\progra~1\norton~1".

Using:
If you want to launch all plug-ins run "launch.bat".
If you want to ccApp and shut it down in a loop use "loop restart.bat". This will launch all plug-ins, wait 10 secs, then shut each copy of ccApp down in series.
