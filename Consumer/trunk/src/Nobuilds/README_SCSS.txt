System Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------

Listed below are the minimum system requirements 
for installing Norton AntiVirus Online.

Norton AntiVirus Online supports Intel and AMD processors only.

Windows XP Home Edition/Professional
300-MHz or higher processor
256 MB of RAM 
180 MB of available disk space
Internet Explorer 6.0 or later*


*An Internet Explorer update can be found at the 
following locations:

1.  If you purchased this version of Norton AntiVirus Online 
on CD, it can be found in the Support folder on the CD 
at the following location (..\support\MSIE\ie6setup.exe).  

2.  If you downloaded this version of Norton AntiVirus Online 
from the Symantec Store Web site, you can download the 
most current version of Internet Explorer at:
http://download.microsoft.com 


--------------------------------------------------------
Supported Email/IM Clients
--------------------------------------------------------

Norton AntiVirus Online supports most Email clients that use the
POP3 email protocol.

Norton AntiVirus Online supports the following IM Clients:
MSN Messenger 6.0 and later
AOL Instant Messenger 4.7 and later
Windows Messenger 4.7 and later
Yahoo! Messenger 5.0 and later


--------------------------------------------------------
Load Auto-Protect during system boot failure
--------------------------------------------------------

If the option for Load Auto-Protect during system boot 
is grayed out (XP only), you will need to download XP 
Service Pack 2.  Service Pack 2 contains all of the correct
patches and hotfixes from Microsoft necessary to correct
the issue.


--------------------------------------------------------
How to save a MSI log file to troubleshoot install and 
uninstall issues
--------------------------------------------------------

If Norton AntiVirus Online fails to install, we recommend saving 
the Norton AntiVirus Online (Date/Time).LOG file that is 
generated by default during your installation of Norton 
AntiVirus Online.  This will help the Symantec Support Team to 
resolve your issue faster. After uninstalling Norton 
AntiVirus Online, there should be two Norton AntiVirus Online.log 
files. The install log should show an earlier date and time, and 
smaller KB size. The uninstall log should show a later date and 
time, and a larger KB size. 

To locate this log file: 
1.  On the Windows taskbar, click Start>Run.
2.  Type the following command "%temp%".
3.  This should automatically launch the Windows
    temporary directory.
4.  Find a file called "Norton AntiVirus Online(Date/Time).log." 


--------------------------------------------------------
Supported Ports for Norton AntiVirus Online email protection
--------------------------------------------------------

Norton AntiVirus Online only supports email scanning on the 
default ports of 110 (POP3) & 25 (SMTP). Currently, we 
do not provide email protection for any other ports.


--------------------------------------------------------
Digitally signing emails in Outlook Express 6.x and 
Office XP
--------------------------------------------------------

Outlook Express 6.x offers the ability to digitally sign
emails to ensure that they are not modified during 
transfer. Norton AntiVirus Online email protection will modify 
the emails during virus repair. This will create an 
Outlook alert stating the message has been modified. 


--------------------------------------------------------
Order of installation for Symantec products
--------------------------------------------------------

The following products integrate with one another and 
use shared components:  

Norton AntiVirus Online
Norton Internet Security
Norton Personal Firewall
Norton SystemWorks

If you need to install two or more of these products 
from different product release years, install them in 
chronological order. For example, first install Norton 
SystemWorks 2005, and then install Norton Internet 
Security 2006. If Norton Internet Security 2006 is already 
installed on your computer, you should uninstall it, 
install Norton SystemWorks 2005, and then re-install 
Norton Internet Security 2006.


--------------------------------------------------------
Dynamic Volumes on Windows XP
--------------------------------------------------------

Norton AntiVirus Online does not fully support Dynamic Volumes.
Scanning these drives may result in the error message,
"Unable to read boot record on drive." This error occurs  
because these drives are not bootable. However, Norton 
AntiVirus will scan the drive for infected files.


--------------------------------------------------------
Using Norton AntiVirus Online with directory symbolic
links/NTFS junctions 
--------------------------------------------------------

Using directory symbolic links, also known as NTFS
junctions, on Windows XP computers may increase hard drive scanning times due
 to repeated scanning.

OVERVIEW
========

This package contains C software to implement JPEG image 
compression and decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") 
is a standardized compression method for full-color and 
gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing 
"real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other 
non-realistic images are not its strong suit.  JPEG is 
lossy, meaning that the output image is not exactly 
identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use 
JPEG if you have to have identical output bits.  
However, on typical photographic images, very good 
compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, 
and remarkably high compression levels are possible if 
you can tolerate a low-quality image.  For more details, 
see the references, or just experiment with various 
compression settings.

This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, 
and progressive compression processes.  Provision is made 
for supporting all variants of these processes, although 
some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.  
For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the 
arithmetic-coding variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  
We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical 
or lossless processes defined in the standard.

We provide a set of library routines for reading and 
writing JPEG image files, plus two sample applications 
"cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to perform 
conversion between JPEG and some other popular image 
file formats. The library is intended to be reused in 
other applications.

In order to support file conversion and viewing software, 
we have included considerable functionality beyond the 
bare JPEG coding/decoding capability; for example, the 
color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped 
file formats or colormapped displays.  These extra 
functions can be compiled out of the library if not 
required for a particular application.  We have also 
included "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding 
between different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and 
"wrjpgcom", two simple applications for inserting and 
extracting textual comments in JFIF files.

The emphasis in designing this software has been on 
achieving portability and flexibility, while also making 
it fast enough to be useful.  In particular, the software 
is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, 
it is intended to be reliable, portable, industrial-strength 
code.  We do not claim to have achieved that goal in every 
aspect of the software, but we strive for it.

We welcome the use of this software as a component of 
commercial products. No royalty is required, but we do 
ask for an acknowledgement in product documentation, as 
described under LEGAL ISSUES.


LEGAL ISSUES
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you 
   find any bugs, please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You 
   don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  
   If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere 
   in your documentation that you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either 
express or implied, with respect to this software, its 
quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular 
purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, 
assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and 
distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, 
without fee, subject to these conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is 
distributed, then this README file must be included, with this 
copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, 
deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly 
indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the 
accompanying documentation must state that "this software 
is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only 
if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable 
consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of 
any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or 
based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  
If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's 
name or company name in advertising or publicity relating 
to this software or products derived from it.  This software 
may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's 
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this 
software as the basis of commercial products, provided 
that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the 
product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission 
of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, 
Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered 
by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual 
distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, 
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  
(See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since 
ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from 
the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing 
paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced 
with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software 
Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for 
its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, 
ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright 
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG 
spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  
Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without 
obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason, support 
for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG 
software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal 
gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that 
very many implementations will support it.) So far as we 
are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining 
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and 
write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW 
patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, 
and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce 
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the 
LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than 
usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright 
    property of CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a 
    Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."


REFERENCES
==========

We highly recommend reading one or more of these references 
before trying to understand the innards of the JPEG software.

The best short technical introduction to the JPEG 
compression algorithm is
	Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression 
        Standard",
	Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), 
pp. 30-44. (Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG 
motion picture compression, applications of JPEG, and related 
topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue handy, a PostScript 
file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is 
available at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz.  
The file (actually a preprint for an article that appeared 
in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics) omits the sample images 
that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections and some 
added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM 
and IEEE, and it may not be used for commercial purposes.

A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to 
JPEG can be found in "The Data Compression Book" by Mark 
Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by M&T Books (New York), 
2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides good 
explanations and example C code for a multitude of 
compression methods including JPEG.  It is an excellent 
source if you are comfortable reading C code but don't 
know much about data compression in general.  The book's 
JPEG sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when 
you are ready to look at a full implementation, you've got 
one here...

The best full description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG 
Still Image Data Compression Standard" by William B. 
Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand 
Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp.
The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG 
standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).  This is 
by far the most complete exposition of JPEG in existence, 
and we highly recommend it.

The JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; 
you must order a paper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless 
you feel a need to own a certified official copy, we 
recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead;
it's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful 
explanatory material.) In the USA, copies of the standard 
may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212) 642-4900, or from 
Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI 
doesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  
It's not cheap: as of 1992, ANSI was charging $95 for 
Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7% shipping/handling.  
The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the
actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance 
testing methods.  Part 1 is titled "Digital Compression 
and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 1: 
Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers 
ISO/IEC IS 10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled 
"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone 
Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document
numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.

Some extensions to the original JPEG standard are 
defined in JPEG Part 3, a newer ISO standard numbered 
ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 and ITU-T T.84.  IJG currently does 
not support any Part 3 extensions.

The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an 
interchangeable file format.  For the omitted details 
we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision
1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is available from:
	Literature Department
	C-Cube Microsystems, Inc.
	1778 McCarthy Blvd.
	Milpitas, CA 95035
	phone (408) 944-6300,  fax (408) 944-6314
A PostScript version of this document is available by 
FTP at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  There is 
also a plain text version at 
ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing
the figures.

The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained 
by FTP from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  
The JPEG incorporation scheme found in the TIFF 6.0 spec 
of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems. IJG does not 
recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).
Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF 
Technical Note #2 (Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note 
can be obtained from ftp.sgi.com or 
from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that 
the next revision of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 
JPEG design with the Note's design. Although IJG's own code 
does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library uses our 
library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is 
available from ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/.


ARCHIVE LOCATIONS
=================

The "official" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net 
(Internet address 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released 
version can always be found there in directory graphics/jpeg.  
This particular version will be archived as 
ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz.  If you 
don't have direct Internet access, UUNET's archives are also 
available via UUCP; contact help@uunet.uu.net for information 
on retrieving files that way.

Numerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files.  
However, only ftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest 
official version.

You can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible "zip" 
archive format from the SimTel archives 
(ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/), or
on CompuServe in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), 
library 12 "JPEG Tools".  Again, these versions may sometimes 
lag behind the ftp.uu.net release.

The JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a 
useful source of general information about JPEG.  It is 
updated constantly and therefore is not included in this 
distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks to Usenet 
newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups.
It is available on the World Wide Web at

RELATED SOFTWARE
================

Numerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support 
JPEG.  (Quite a few of them use this library to do so.)  
The JPEG FAQ described above lists some of the more popular 
free and shareware viewers, and tells where to obtain them on 
Internet.

If you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef 
Poskanzer's free PBMPLUS software, which provides many useful 
operations on PPM-format image files.  In particular, it can 
convert PPM images to and from a wide range of other formats, 
thus making cjpeg/djpeg considerably more useful.  The latest
version is distributed by the NetPBM group, and is available 
from numerous sites, notably 
ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/.
Unfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the 
IJG software is; you are likely to have difficulty making it 
work on any non-Unix machine.

A different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG 
group at Stanford, is available from 
ftp://havefun.stanford.edu/pub/jpeg/.  This program is designed 
for research and experimentation rather than production use;
it is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG 
code, but it is easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG 
code supports lossless JPEG, which we do not.  (On the other 
hand, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)


FILE FORMAT WARS
================

Some JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible 
with our library. The root of the problem is that the ISO 
JPEG committee failed to specify a concrete file format.  
Some vendors "filled in the blanks" on their own, creating 
proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For example, 
none of the early commercial JPEG implementations for the 
Macintosh were able to exchange compressed files.)

The file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see 
REFERENCES).  This format has been agreed to by a number 
of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has become the de 
facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or "low end" representation.
We recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as 
modified by TIFF Technical Note #2) for "high end" applications 
that need to record a lot of additional data about an image.  
TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely supported, 
unfortunately.

The upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format 
called SPIFF. SPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense 
that most JFIF decoders should be able to read the most common 
variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some technical advantages over 
JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an 
official standard rather than an informal one.  At this point 
it is unclear whether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether 
JFIF will remain the de-facto standard.  IJG intends to support 
SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we have not decided 
whether it should become our default output format or not.
(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading 
JFIF indefinitely.)

Various proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression 
also exist. We have little or no sympathy for the existence of 
these formats.  Indeed, one of the original reasons for 
developing this free software was to help force convergence 
on common, open format standards for JPEG files.  Don't use a 
proprietary file format!


TO DO
=====

The major thrust for v7 will probably be improvement of 
visual quality. The current method for scaling the quantization 
tables is known not to be very good at low Q values.  We also 
intend to investigate block boundary smoothing, "poor man's 
variable quantization", and other means of improving 
quality-vs-file-size performance without sacrificing compatibility.

In future versions, we are considering supporting some of 
the upcoming JPEG Part 3 extensions --- principally, variable 
quantization and the SPIFF file format.

As always, speeding things up is of great interest.

Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to
