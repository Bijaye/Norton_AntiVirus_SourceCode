To modify an existing manifest:
-------------------------------

1. To modify existing manifest X, check out the following files:
    Unsigned\X.xml
    Signed\X.spm
    Signed\X.grd
    Signed\X.sig

2. Make the desired modifications to X.xml
3. Run MakeSigned.btm
4. Have X.grd signed by RPS (rps.corp.symantec.com)
5. Replace X.sig with the file you get from RPS
6. Check the 4 files back in


To create a new manifest X associated with a merge module (X.msm) or msi (X.msi):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create ConfigFiles\XConfig.xml configuration file
2. Add an entry for X to BuildUnsigned.btm and run it.
3. Add an entry to FixNames and run it if necessary
4. Do any hand tweaking to Unsigned\X.xml
5. Add an entry for X to BuildSigned.btm and run it
6. Have X.grd signed by RPS
7. Check in ConfigFiles\XConfig.xml, Unsigned\X.xml, Signed\X.spm, Signed\X.grd and Signed\X.sig

NOTE: Steps 1-3 can be skipped if you are creating a custom manifest file that is not associated with a merge module
      or msi (such as NAV_Dirs.xml, NAV_Krnl.xml, or OpenCmd.xml).

NOTE: This process mainly protects registry keys specified in the merge module or msi. Files and directories will
      need to be protected by creating a seperate X_Dirs.xml. Merge modules and msi's w/o registry keys produce an
      xml file containing no usable output, and can thus be removed from the entrys.

NOTE: "Hand tweaking" of Unsigned\X.xml includes removal of sub-keys, since protectiing the root key protects the
      sub-keys as well.

NOTE: There is no need to protect merge modules which are related only to install (such as NAVInst.wsm), since they
      are never used in the running product.
