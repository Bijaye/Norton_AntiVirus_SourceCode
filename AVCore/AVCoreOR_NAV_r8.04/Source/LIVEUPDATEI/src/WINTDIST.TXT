"Wintdist.exe" is a required Microsoft executable that must be run during your product's installation.  This particular executable is only compatible with Windows95 and Windows NT 4.0.

Note: You'll need to add a command line switch /q to make this executable run in quiet mode (no dialogs should appear when the /q switch is used).
