Build instructions for snavapi for different platforms.


First, create a temporary clientspec for Perforce based the clientspec "snavapi",
with the root renamed to a directory on your machine. Switch to the clientspec
you created, and sync all files onto your machine.

NOTE: You may need to copy some source files from the following location into
your build directory/path:

//depot/core/trunk/Source/INCLUDE/SRC/


Win32:
1. install 4nt and set it up for the standard env/proj build system
2. run in a 4nt window the command "env avcore"
3. run "proj snavapi"
4. choose "ida" for debug or "ira" for release
5. cd to the snavapi source directory (example: "c:\perf\snavapi")
6. copy the version of navapi32.dll, navapi.vxd, and navapi.h you are testing
   from the release directory (example:
   "c:\perf\navapi\version41\latest\BinIntelAnsiWin32Release") into snavapi
   source directory (example: "c:\perf\snavapi")
7. run "mk"
8. snavapi can now be run by typing "snavapi32"

If using VC, you will need the following files:
1. Under //depot/core/NAVAPI.09C/source/INCLUDE/src/
   	platform.h
	PLATWIN.h
	symvxd.h
	dbcs_str.h

2. Under //depot/Release/navapi/version41/latest/
	navapi.h   &
        /LibIntelAnsiWin32Debug/NAVAPI32.lib

NLM:
1. currently, snavapi cannot be run on unix. Use stscan to test under unix.
   Stscan can be found under Perforce at 
   "//depot/Norton_Antivirus/AVCore/Trunk/Source/NAVAPIST.QA/SRC/".


Solaris:
1. install P4 and set the clientspec to the one you created
2. cd to the snavapi source directory
   (example: "/export/home/thwang/perf/snavapi")
3. copy the version of libavenge.a, libnavapi.a, libsymkunix.a, navapi.h you
   are testing from the release directory (example:
   "/export/home/thwang/perf/navapi/version41/latest/LibSolarisRelease")
   into snavapi source directory (example: "/export/home/thwang/perf/snavapi")
4. run "make -f sol.mak"
5. snavapi can now be run by typing "snavapi32"
