                   ABOUT LIVEUPDATE ADMINISTRATOR
**********************************************************************

LiveUpdate is the Symantec technology that permits an installed
Symantec product to connect to a Symantec server automatically for
program and virus definitions updates.  The connection is made through
either a preset telephone number or FTP site.  For corporate sites,
two problems have arisen:

 * Network traffic: Administrators want to reduce external traffic
   by having users download from an internal site. 

 * Security: LiveUpdate establishes an FTP connection to a Symantec
   server.  This implementation, in some cases, requires modification
   to firewall software. 

Symantec developed the LiveUpdate Administration Utility, LUADMIN.EXE,
to address these issues.  You can set up an Intranet FTP server or
simply a directory on a standard file server to handle all LiveUpdate
operations for your network.  Users connect to an internal server to
retrieve updates instead of connecting to external Symantec servers.

To set up a LiveUpdate Intranet server, you must do the following:

 * Install the LiveUpdate Administration Utility.

 * Create a custom host file (LIVEUPDT.HST) that points client
   machines to the internal server using the LiveUpdate Administration
   Utility (LUADMIN.EXE).

 * Distribute the host file (LIVEUPDT.HST) to all workstations that
   use the LiveUpdate feature.

 * Download update packages from Symantec to the internal server 
   using the LiveUpdate Administration Utility (LUADMIN.EXE). 


**********************************************************************
              INSTALLING THE LIVEUPDATE ADMINISTRATOR
**********************************************************************

The LiveUpdate Administrator is distributed as a self-extracting,
compressed archive (LUAU.EXE).

To install the LiveUpdate Administrator:

 1 Run LUAU.EXE.

 2 This is a self-extracting installation program. Wizards will lead
   you through the entire installation process.

 3 The LiveUpdate Administrator also has an uninstaller. This can be
   accessed through Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel.


**********************************************************************
                        LIVEUPDATE UNC SUPPORT
**********************************************************************

The current version of LiveUpdate supports the download of packages
from an internal server via UNC support without the need for an FTP
server. The support consists of 2 components:

 1 A new LiveUpdate DLL which supports UNC download (S32LUHL1.DLL).

 2 A customized host file created by the LiveUpdate Administration
   Utility which points to the internal server.

By default, the UNC DLL becomes the exclusive transport when it is
present. The intent is to prevent users from using FTP or modem when
the administrator has determined that it is better for them to use
a UNC path.

Under Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 it is possible for LiveUpdate 1.4
to have "Network" available as one of the connection options in the
LiveUpdate wizard. The following registry entry needs to be made under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Symantec\LiveUpdate\Preferences:

Name: All Transports Available
Type: DWORD

If this entry is non-zero and S32LUHL1.DLL is present in the
LiveUpdate directory then Network will be an available connection
option.

One possible use of this feature is that a host file could contain
an entry for an internal UNC location as well as the Symantec FTP
and modem servers. This would be an ideal setup for mobile
professionals who use laptops.

NOTE: UNC support is only available with the 32 bit version of
LiveUpdate.


**********************************************************************
           CREATING A LIVEUPDATE HOST FILE FOR WORKSTATIONS
**********************************************************************

LIVEUPDT.HST is the host file that controls LiveUpdate operation on 
workstations.  You must create a new file that points to an internal 
server to replace the existing LIVEUPDT.HST on workstations.

To create a custom host file:

 1 Run LUADMIN.EXE.

 2 Click the Host Editor tab.

 3 Click Open.

 4 Select SAMPLE.HST, located in the current directory.

 5 Enter the following information:

   Description group box
   ---------------------
   Name:     Displayed when users connect to the internal server.
   Country:  Country where your server is located.

   Login group box
   ---------------
   Name:     Username for the FTP server. All users use the same name.
   Password: Password for the specified username.

   Connection group box
   --------------------
   Number:   Either the IP address of the server or an Internet-style
             name (URL) for the server.
   Area:     The telephone dialing code for the server's location.
   Country:  The international telephone dialing code for the country
             where the server is located.  "1" is the United States.

   Type
   ----
   Choose FTP if you are creating an internal FTP server. If you are
   intending to use a UNC directory please see the next section of
   this document.

   16 bit/32 bit
   -------------
   The 32 bit radio button will normally be selected. If you are
   creating a host file for 16 bit LiveUpdate clients please select
   the 16 bit radio button. If the 16 bit version of LiveUpdate is
   installed then the DLLs in the LiveUpdate directory will have
   names starting with S16... If the 32 bit version is installed, the
   file names will start with S32... Note that the 16 bit and 32 bit
   host files are not compatible with each other.

   The other text boxes displayed in this group are for information
   only.  They are not editable.

 6 Click Save to access the Save As dialog box.

 7 Save the customized file as LIVEUPDT.HST. 

   Do not use any other name. The file must be named LIVEUPDT.HST.

LIVEUPDT.HST is ready for distribution.  Copy LIVEUPDT.HST to the 
"C:\Program Files\Symantec\LiveUpdate" folder on user workstations. 
Typically, you modify your network login scripts to perform the copy 
automatically. 


**********************************************************************
        CREATING A LIVEUPDATE UNC HOST FILE FOR WORKSTATIONS
**********************************************************************

The UNC host is created in a similar way to other host files using
the Host Editor tab of the LiveUpdate Administration Utility.
The following fields should be set:

 1 Description: a descriptive name for the server which is displayed
   to the user when running LiveUpdate.

 2 User name: a user name with access rights to the server. If this
   field is left blank, LiveUpdate will attempt to connect using the
   current user name logged into the system.

 3 Password: the password which corresponds to the user name. If this
   field is left blank, LiveUpdate will use the password for the
   current user logged into the system.

 4 Connection number: the UNC path to the server directory containing
   the packages.

 5 Type: this should be set to LAN.

 NOTE: Windows 95 systems connecting to a Windows NT server creates a
 special issue. Windows 95 users need to have access rights to the
 resource - if a user name and password are supplied in the host file
 they will be ignored. The solution is to create a shared resource on
 the NT server which all users are authorized to access.


**********************************************************************
                      IMPLEMENTING UNC SUPPORT
**********************************************************************

After the host file is created, simply copy it along with the new UNC DLL
(S32LUHL1.DLL) to the LiveUpdate directory on the client machines. 
The default directories are:

\Program Files\Symantec\LiveUpdate    for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0
\Win32app\Symantec\LiveUpdate         for Windows NT 3.51


**********************************************************************
            UPDATING THE LIVEUPDATE ADMINISTRATION UTILITY
**********************************************************************

The LiveUpdate Administration Utility can update itself.  To check for
updates, click Update on the Update tab.  If an update is
available, it will appear in the Select Updates panel.  Check the 
package and it will be installed automatically.


**********************************************************************
                        RETRIEVING PACKAGES
**********************************************************************

LiveUpdate packages should be placed in the root of the FTP server or
in the UNC directory specified in the host file. In addition to the
downloaded packages, LUADMIN retrieves index files called SYMTRI.ZIP,
LIVETRI.ZIP and SYMTRI16.ZIP. These files are required by different
versions of LiveUpdate.

To retrieve update packages: 

 1 Run LUADMIN.EXE.

 2 Click the Retrieve Packages tab.

 3 Select the desired language for download packages.

 4 Check the Symantec products that will be supported. 

   Because all installed Symantec products that use LiveUpdate now
   point to your Intranet server, always check all products that are
   used in your organization. If you don't select all products, you
   may miss an available update.

 5 Specify the Download Directory. This is the location where the
   update packages and support files will be stored when downloaded
   from Symantec. It can be a temporary "holding" area or it can be
   the FTP or UNC location specified in the host file.

 6 Click Retrieve to begin the administrator LiveUpdate. 

   Follow the instructions in each succeeding panel to retrieve
   the packages.

 7 Copy the entire contents of the download directory to the root of
   your FTP server or to the UNC directory.

The next time users click LiveUpdate from their workstations, they
will receive the packages from your internal server, not Symantec's
external server. 


**********************************************************************
                     AUTOMATIC PACKAGE RETRIEVAL
**********************************************************************

A new feature called Silent LiveUpdate Administrator allows scheduled
liveupdates to retrieve all the packages you need. If you run the
program SilntLUA.exe (normally installed to
\program files\liveupdate administrator\) then packages will be
retrieved without any user intervention required.  The only indication
that this program is running is the task bar icon (labeled "Silent LU
Admin") which remains until the program exits.

Please note that you first need to run LiveUpdate Administrator
to select the products to support, the language and the download
location.  Once LiveUpdate Administrator exits, the settings are saved
and Silent LiveUpdate Administrator will use them every time it runs.


**********************************************************************
             ROLLING OUT AN UPDATED VERSION OF LIVEUPDATE
**********************************************************************

You can download the latest lusetup file from the Symantec web site at

ftp://ftp/public/english_us_canada/liveupdate/updates/lusetup.exe

The installer can be run silently. Use a command line switch /s to use
this functionality.

You can check the version of LiveUpdate contained in the installer by
checking the properties of the installer. The installer has the same
version number as the version of LiveUpdate it will install.

NOTE: If you have created a custom host file, installing a LiveUpdate
upgrade using LUSETUP.EXE should not replace the host file. However,
if the first host in your custom HST file is Symantec's BBS in Eugene
then the file will be replaced and you should roll out your custom host
file again. If not, The custom host file will be left on the user's
system unchanged and the Symantec host file will be placed in the
directory using the filename LIVEUPDT.HST.DEFAULT.


**********************************************************************
           USE OF THE CUSTOM TAB IN LIVEUPDATE ADMINISTRATOR
**********************************************************************

The Custom tab in LiveUpdate Administrator version 1.4 is for use by
customers who receive packages directly from Symantec that are not yet
released on the LiveUpdate production servers.  These packages can be
used to address unique situations such as virus definitions that
detect and remove a brand new virus or other specific needs for our
customers.

These packages can be rolled out to client systems along with any
production packages that are available from Symantec.

The "Custom update location" specifies where the packages you received
from Symantec are located on your system.  You can use the browse
button to locate the files.

The "Active custom updates" box lists any current custom updates that
are being applied by LiveUpdate Administrator.  The custom updates can
be deleted manually using the delete button or if the "Automatically
delete obsolete custom updates" box is checked, the packages will be
deleted once all the date information in the packages indicate they
are older than the production LiveUpdate packages.

You will be informed by SARC or Platinum support if you need to use
this option and how to proceed further.
