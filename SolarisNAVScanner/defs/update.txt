=====================================================================
VIII. Norton AntiVirus Network Manager
=====================================================================

 IMPORTANT! Check the Norton AntiVirus version first
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 Check the date of the Norton AntiVirus Network Manager executable 
 file (NAVNET.EXE) to see if it is earlier than June 1, 1996. If it 
 is, you must update it with the UPDATEME.EXE patch before installing 
 these definitions. These new virus definitions are not compatible 
 with older versions of Norton AntiVirus, and may cause it to report 
 false virus detections. 

 This patch is available on the Symantec BBS (541-484-6669), the 
 Symantec FTP site (ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/...), the Symantec 
 Web site (http://www.symantec.com/nav/index_updates.html), 
 CompuServe, or America Online. You can also call Customer Service
 at (800) 441-7234 to order a disk set.

 Download or copy the UPDATEME.EXE patch file to a temporary 
 directory. The network files must exist in your local directory or 
 the UPDATEME.EXE patch will not extract the network files. Copy 
 NAVNET.EXE and NAVNETW.EXE to your local NAV directory. Then run 
 UPDATEME.EXE to extract the files. The complete directions are 
 explained in the READ.ME file. 

 After updating Norton AntiVirus Network Manager, recreate your .NNS 
 files using the new _DEFAULT.NNS as a template. For more information 
 on recreating .NNS files, order FaxBack #913024 from our free 
 FaxBack service at (541) 984-2490, option 2.

 The NAV 3.11 patch contains the April 1997 virus definition set. You
 must apply the latest virus definition set update after completing
 the program update.

 Updating Norton AntiVirus Network Manager virus definitions
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. On a workstation connected to the network, map a drive letter to 
    the volume and directory where Norton AntiVirus Network Manager
    is installed. You must have read and write access to the mapped 
    drive.
 2. At a DOS prompt, change to the directory that contains the 
    Intelligent Updater file. 
 3. Type mmddI16.EXE [path] (or mmddI161.EXE [path] if using the
    multi-disk floppy disk set) where the [path] is the location of
    the Norton AntiVirus Network Manager that you just mapped. The
    mmdd represents the date of the definition set. For example, the
    filename would be 1231I16.EXE for the December 31 definition set.
 4. Follow the instructions on screen.
 5. Start Norton AntiVirus from the Norton AntiVirus Network Manager
    directory and scan the Norton AntiVirus Network Manager directory 
    to activate the new virus definitions and rebuild critical files. 
    To do this, type NAV from the Norton AntiVirus Network Manager 
    directory.

 
=====================================================================
IX. Norton AntiVirus Network Manager for Win95 and WinNT
=====================================================================

 Installing the definitions for Network Manager involves three steps.
   1. Find the directory where virus definitions are stored.
   2. Copy the appropriate Intelligent Updater program to that 
      directory.
   3. Run the Intelligent Updater program using the /dump command to 
      extract the appropriate files.

 Locating the Definitions Directory
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Find the .NNS file that Norton AntiVirus uses to distribute 
    files. To find out which .NNS file the network uses, check the 
    network login script. If it uses a customized .NNS file, the 
    login script will specify the location of that file. If not, 
    search the login script for the location of the NAVCHECK.EXE and 
    NAV32UP.EXE distribution files. The default .NNS file 
    (_DEFLT32.NNS) will be in the directory containing NAVCHECK.EXE 
    and NAV32UP.EXE.
 2. Look in the .NNS file for the parameter that points to the virus 
    definitions directory. 
      * In NavNet32 v2.0, the parameter "NAVDefDir" points to 
        the definitions. 
      * In NavNet32 v4.x, the parameter "NAVDefDir95" points to the 
        Norton AntiVirus for Windows 95 definitions. The parameter 
        "NAVDefDirNTWKS" points to the Norton AntiVirus for NT 
        workstation definitions, and "NAVDefDirNTSRV" points to the 
        Norton AntiVirus for NT server definitions.
 3. Note the definitions directory to be updated. 

 Updating Definitions for Norton AntiVirus 2.0 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Map a drive letter to the network volume and directory containing 
    the definitions to be updated. You must have WRITE access to the 
    mapped drive.
 2. Copy (do not Move) the mmddI16.EXE file to the mapped network 
    definitions directory. The mmdd represents the date of the    
    definition set. For example, the filename would be 1231I16.EXE 
    for the December 31 definition set.
 3. Open a command line session (DOS box) and change to the mapped 
    drive containing the older definitions and the new Intelligent 
    Updater program.
 4. To update definitions type mmddI16 /DUMP.
 5. Delete mmddI16.EXE (or mmddI161.EXE) from the definitions 
    directory.

 Updating Definitions for Norton AntiVirus 4.0 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Map a drive letter to the network volume and directory containing 
    the definitions to be updated. You must have WRITE access to the 
    mapped drive.
 2. Copy (do not Move) the mmddI32.EXE file to the mapped network 
    definitions directory. The mmdd represents the date of the    
    definition set. For example, the filename would be 1231I32.EXE 
    for the December 31 definition set.
 3. Open a command line session (DOS box) and change to the mapped 
    drive containing the older definitions and the new Intelligent 
    Updater program.
 4. To update definitions type mmddI16 /DUMP 
 5. Delete mmddI32.EXE from the definitions directory.


=====================================================================
X. Norton System Center
=====================================================================

 See the Norton System Center documentation for instructions on 
 distributing virus definitions with Central LiveUpdate. To 
 distribute virus definition updates without Central LiveUpdate:

 1. Download the latest version of Intelligent Updater (v4.0).

 2. Copy Intelligent Updater to the definitions folder of your NSC 
    installation. By default the location is the 
    \NSC Repository\Products\NAV\Defs\Intel or Alpha folder.

 3. To avoid changing the job every time you update the definitions, 
    rename the Intelligent Updater file as NEWDEFS.EXE and set the 
    job to run this file. Otherwise you will always have to modify 
    the job to use the correct file name. 

 4. Start Norton System Center and run your virus definitions rollout 
    job. For more information on setting up NSC jobs, see your NSC
    documentation.

 Whenever you want to distribute updated virus definitions, download 
 a new Intelligent Updater, copy it to the source distribution 
 folder, rename it NEWDEFS.EXE, and rerun the job. 


=====================================================================
XI. Norton AntiVirus for NT Server, DEC Alpha version
=====================================================================

1. Download the file mmddA32.ZIP.
2. Unzip this file into the Incoming directory: 
   \Program Files\Common Files\Symantec Shared\VirusDefs\Incoming 
3. Norton AntiVirus will automatically begin using the new 
   definitions.

=====================================================================
XII. Norton AntiVirus for OS/2
=====================================================================

1. Download the file mmddO32.ZIP.
2. Unzip this file into the Incoming directory: 
   \SYMANTEC\COMMON\SHARED\VIRUSDEFS\INCOMING
3. Norton AntiVirus will automatically begin using the new 
   definitions.

=====================================================================
XIII. Installing Virus Definition Files Manually
=====================================================================

 If you do not want Intelligent Updater to install the new virus
 definitions for you automatically, you can use the /DUMP command to
 extract the virus definition files, then copy the appropriate files
 to the virus definitions folder. 

 Installing Virus Definition Files Manually
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Copy the Intelligent Updater program (mmddI16.EXE, mmddI161.EXE,
    mmddI32.EXE, or mmddN16.EXE) to an empty, temporary folder.

 2. Launch the Intelligent Updater program using the /DUMP command. 
    This will extract all the virus definitions to the folder. For 
    example, type mmddI32.EXE /DUMP to extract the files. The mmdd 
    represents the date of the definition set. For example, the 
    filename would be 1231I32.EXE for the December 31 definition set.

 3. Copy the files to the virus definition folder. If you are using 
    Norton AntiVirus 4.0 or 5.0 for Windows 95 / Windows NT Server &
    Workstation, copy the files to this location:
    C:\Program Files\Common Files\Symantec Shared\VirusDefs\Incoming\

    NOTE: Copy the file ZDONE.DAT last. This file signals Norton
    AntiVirus that the definition set has been completely loaded. If
    it is not loaded last, it may cause errors.

 4. Refer to the Intelligent Updater File List below for information
    on which files to copy into the Norton AntiVirus folder.
