<H1> About the Symantec AntiVirus Immune System</H1>
<P>
The AntiVirus Immune System (AVIS) is an automated virus sample submission and definition delivery system to provide customers with real-time protection against heuristically detected <I>new</I> viruses. 
<P>
The AVIS network connects all computers worldwide that run Symantec AntiVirus with the antivirus analysis center. Samples of files or boot sectors that may be infected with a new virus are captured on protected computers and sent through the network to the analysis center, which collects and automatically analyzes the samples.  
<P>
If a new virus is found, the center automatically produces new virus definitions, the signatures used to detect, verify, and remove the new virus. The new definitions are packaged as updates to Symantec AntiVirus products and distributed immediately to any customer that reports the new virus. The signatures are later distributed to all other customers to prevent the new virus from spreading further.
