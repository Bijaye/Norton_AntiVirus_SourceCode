<H1>X-CHECKSUM-METHOD ATTRIBUTE</H1>

<P>The proprietary X-Checksum-Method attribute is included in messages with non-empty content. This attribute tells the receiver what method was used to calculate checksums of the content. The value is the name of the checksum method. The only checksum method used in the Immune System is the Message Digest version 5 (MD5) algorithm, as specified by RFC 1321.</P>
<P>For example, when a message contains a sample, the message will include this attribute:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X-Checksum-Method: md5</P>
<P>This attribute is omitted if the content of the message is null.</P>
