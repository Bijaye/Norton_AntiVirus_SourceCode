<H1> Analysis States</H1>
The AntiVirus Immune System network reports the status of samples that have been submitted as they progress through the analysis process with the X-Analysis-State attribute. 
    The state may indicate where in the network hierarchy a sample is located, 
    or what stage of the analysis pipeline is currently working on the sample, 
    or its final disposition.
<blockquote>
<P>
    <a href="#final"><b>Final States</b></a><BR>
    <a href="#transit"><b>Transit States</b></a><BR>

</blockquote>
<P> <a name="final"></a> <B>Final States</B><BR>
  Samples that have been finished are in one of the final states. All nodes in 
  the Immune System use the terminal states. After a sample has been placed in 
  a terminal state, its state will not change again. The X-Date-Analyzed attribute 
  is set when a sample is placed into a terminalstate; its presence means that 
  the value of X-Analysis-State is terminal. 
<UL>
  <LI><b>uninfectable</b>: The sample contains no executable code, and therefore 
    cannot be infected with any virus. The sample may be too small to contain 
    any executable code, or may contain data only, such as a graphic image or 
    an audio clip.</LI>
  <LI><b>unsubmitable</b>: The sample contains known malicious software which 
    is not a virus, such as a trojan horse.</LI>
  <LI><b>declined</b>: The sample is not acceptable, and has been politely but 
    firmly refused.</LI>
  <LI><b>nodetect</b>: The sample has not been analyzed, but does not contain 
    any apparent suspicious code.</LI>
  <LI><b>infected</b>: The sample is infected with a virus, and can be repaired 
    with available virus definition files.</LI>
  <LI><b>uninfected</b>: The sample has been analyzed and no virus was found.</LI>
  <LI><b>misfired</b>: The sample has been analyzed and no virus was found, in 
    spite of a detected infection. The incorrectly detected infection was caused 
    by a mistake in previous virus definition files, and the mistake is corrected 
    in newer virus definition files.</LI>
  <LI><b>abort</b>: An internal programming error has derailed transport or analysis 
    of the sample.</LI>
  <LI><b>broken</b>: The sample is infected with a virus, but the definition generation 
    service in the back office reported an error, and no virus definition files 
    are available. </LI>
</UL>
<P> <a name="transit"></a> <B>Transit States</B><BR>
  Samples that have not yet reached the analysis center are in one of the transit states. Only components outside 
  the analysis center use the transit states. A sample may remain in a pending 
  state indefinitely before moving to another state. 
<UL>
  <LI><b>receiving</b>: The sample is being received by a gateway.</LI>
  <LI><b>accepted</b>: The sample has been accepted by a gateway, but not yet 
    imported into the analysis center.</LI>
  <LI><b>importing</b>: The sample is being imported into the analysis center.</LI>
</UL>
<P> <a name="pending"></a> <B>Pending States</B><BR>
  Samples that are awaiting analysis within the analysis center are in one of 
  the pending states. Only components within the analysis center use the pending 
  states. A sample may remain in a pending state indefinitely before moving to 
  another state. 
<UL>
  <LI><b>defer</b>: The sample cannot be analyzed automatically, and will be deferred 
    for analysis by experts.</LI>
  <LI><b>deferred</b>: The sample cannot be analyzed automatically, and has been 
    deferred for analysis by experts.</LI>
  <LI><b>deferring</b>: The sample cannot be analyzed automatically, and is being 
    deferred for analysis by experts.</LI>
  <LI><b>imported</b>: The sample has been imported into the analysis center, 
    but has not yet been analyzed.</LI>
  <LI><b>rescan</b>: The sample must be re-scanned because newer virus definition 
    files have become available within the analysis center.</LI>
</UL>
<P> <a name="active"></a> <B>Active States</B><BR>
  Samples that are being analyzed within the analysis center are in one of the 
  active states. Only the dataflow component within the analysis center uses the 
  active states. A sample may remain in an active state for only a few seconds 
  or for many minutes before moving to another state. 
<UL>
  <LI><b>classifying</b>: The sample is being classified to determine its datatype.</LI>
  <LI><b>binary</b>: The sample has been classified as a binary program, and is 
    waiting for the binary controller.</LI>
  <LI><b>binaryControlling</b>: The binary controller is determining starting 
    conditions for binary replication.</LI>
  <LI><b>binaryWait</b>: The sample is waiting for a binary replication engine 
    to become available.</LI>
  <LI><b>binaryReplicating</b>: The sample is being executed by a binary replication 
    engine.</LI>
  <LI><b>binaryScoring</b>: The sample infected other binary programs, and the 
    binary scoring engine is selecting signatures for detecting and repairing 
    the virus.</LI>
  <LI><b>macro</b>: The sample has been classified as a document or spreadsheet 
    containing executable macros, and is waiting for the macro controller.</LI>
  <LI><b>macroControlling</b>: The macro controller is determining starting conditions 
    for macro replication.</LI>
  <LI><b>macroWait</b>: The sample is waiting for a macro replication engine to 
    become available.</LI>
  <LI><b>macroReplicating</b>: The sample is being executed by a macro replication 
    engine.</LI>
  <LI><b>macroScoring</b>: The sample infected other documents or spreadsheets, 
    and the macro scoring engine is selecting signatures for detecting and repairing 
    the virus.</LI>
  <LI><b>signatures</b>: The sample is infected with a new virus, signatures for 
    detecting and repairing it have been selected, and the sample is waiting for 
    the build process to become available.</LI>
  <LI><b>locking</b>: Exclusive access to the definition generation service in 
    the back office is being acquired.</LI>
  <LI><b>incrBuilding</b>: The signatures selected for the new virus are being 
    added to the current virus definition files.</LI>
  <LI><b>incrUnitTesting</b>: The incremental virus definition files are being 
    unit-tested.</LI>
  <LI><b>fullBuilding</b>: A new set of virus definition files incorporating the 
    signatures selected for the new virus are being built.</LI>
  <LI><b>fullUnitTesting</b>: The full virus definition files are being unit-tested.</LI>
  <LI><b>unlocking</b>: Exclusive access to the definition generation service 
    is being released.</LI>
  <LI><b>archive</b>: The sample is waiting to archive the automated analysis 
    files.</LI>
  <LI><b>archiving</b>: The sample is archiving the automated analysis files.</LI>
