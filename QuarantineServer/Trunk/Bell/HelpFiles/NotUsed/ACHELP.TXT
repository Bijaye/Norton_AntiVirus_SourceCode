.topic  IDH_X_ANALYSIS_SERVICE                        
Indicates that the results in the status message are from a special 
class of analysis service; only supported value is:


quickcheck:  Used for samples that were not fully analyzed


This value specifies that the sample was not fully analyzed and that the 
results are not definitive.

.topic  IDH_X_CONTENT_COMPRESSION                     
Method used to compress the content, if any; value is the name of the 
compression method. Possible values are  "deflate"  for captured samples,
" zip"  for directories of sample analysis files, and "zip"  for directories of 
signature definitions files.

.topic  IDH_X_CONTENT_ENCODING                        
Method used to encode the content, if any. Currently, only Base64 is used.

.topic  IDH_X_CONTENT_SCRAMBLING                      
Method used to scramble the content, if any. Note that content is scrambled 
only to prevent accidental execution of potentially infected samples. Scrambling 
does not provide any security. 


The value is the name of the scrambling method. The only method used by 
the Immune System is XOR with a constant bit-mask.
