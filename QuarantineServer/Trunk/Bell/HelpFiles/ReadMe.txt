ACHelp.H to build the UI is a copy of the one used to build the help. This file should be the same as Tech_Pubs\Corporate\Quarantine\trunk\Help\QConAvis\ACHelp.H.

AvisConsole.chm is a backup of the Q30 version. It should not be picked up here; rather, it is built
from Tech_Pubs\Corporate\Quarantine\trunk\Help\QConAvis. It is left just in case it's referenced by a build script somewhere.
