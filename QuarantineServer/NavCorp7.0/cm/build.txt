How to build Quarantine Server:
------------------------------

First, you'll need to create a client spec based on BUILD_QSERVER.

Once you've done this, and sync'd down all of the areas referenced by the
client spec, go to the QuarantineServer\CM folder and run BUILD.BTM.

This batch file will do a complete release build of all of the Quarantine Server
components.

You can also perform a debug build by specifying /DBG on the command line.

You can inspect the build results by examining the file MAKE.ERR.
