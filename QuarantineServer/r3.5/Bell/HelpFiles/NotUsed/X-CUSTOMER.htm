The proprietary X-Customer attributes are included in all messages from customers to gateways. They identify the customer making the request, and are used for authorization and tracking:<BR><BR>

<a href="#Email"><B>X-Customer-Contact-Email</b></a>: individual contact informationemail address<BR>
<a href="#Name"><B>X-Customer-Contact-Name</b></a>: individual contact name<BR>

<P><a name="#Email"></a>
<B>X-Customer-Contact-Email</b><BR>
This attribute gives individual contact information. The value is a text string of at most 255 characters giving names, telephone numbers, and email addresses that the technical support staff can use to contact the individual who submitted a sample, if necessary.</P>
<P>For example, the contact information for the author is:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X-Customer-Contact-Email: pring@watson.ibm.com</P>

<P><a name="#Name"></a>
<B>X-Customer-Contact-Name</b><BR>
This attribute gives individual contact information. The value is a text string of at most 255 characters giving the full name of an individual the technical support staff can contact, if necessary.</P>
<P>For example, the contact information for the author is:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X-Customer-Contact-Name: Edward Pring</P>

<P><a name="#Telephone"></a>
<B>X-Customer-Contact-Telephone</b><BR>
This attribute gives individual contact information. The value is a text string of at most 255 characters giving the email address of an individual the technical support staff can contact, if necessary. </P>
<P>For example, the contact information for the author is:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X-Customer-Contact-Telephone: 1-914-784-6285</P>

<P><a name="#Credentials"></a>
<B>X-Customer-Credentials</b><BR>This attribute transports customer credentials from a customer client to a gateway. The value of this attribute is a binary string of at most 127 bytes encoded as a hexadecimal string of at most 254 characters in the range "0..9A..F". </P>
<P>The value is obtained by a client when a product is installed or at some later time before a sample is submitted. The value may be encrypted, and must be treated as an opaque string by components that do not have access to the encryption key.</P>
<P>The value is used by a gateway when a sample is received. If the value is encrypted, it is decrypted using a secret shared with the installation program or network service that produced it. The decrypted value is used to authenticate the customer's identity, determine whether the customer is entitled to submit samples, limit the number of samples the customer can submit, and prioritize samples that are accepted for analysis.</P>
<P>For example, the customer credentials for the author are:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X-Customer-Credentials: 0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF.</P>

The attribute may be included by the client when a sample is submitted, or added to a sample by the gateway after the customer's credentials have been decrypted.subscribes to a service plan.</P>
<P>The service class is indicated by one of these text tokens:
