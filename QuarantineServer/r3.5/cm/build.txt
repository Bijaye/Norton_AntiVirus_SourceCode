First, you'll need to create a client spec based on BUILD_QSERVER or BUILD_QSERVER_JEDI.
In addition to the previous Quarantine files in ver 1.0 this will also pull down the new
AvisConsole files.

Once you've done this, and sync'd down all of the areas referenced by the
client spec, go to the QuarantineServer\CM folder and run BUILD.BTM.

This batch file will do a complete release build of all of the Quarantine Server
components, including AvisConsole.dll.

You can also perform a debug build by specifying /DBG on the command line.

You can inspect the build results by examining the file MAKE.ERR.


build.btm calls the following files:

bqs.btm - builds the qserver projects
bice.btm - copys the IcePack binaries to the dir where the Qserver files are stored
bqsislls.btm - builds the installer dll project(s)
bqsi.btm - builds the installer projects
