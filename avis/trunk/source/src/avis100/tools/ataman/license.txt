ATAMAN SOFTWARE, INC. ("LICENSOR") IS WILLING TO LICENSE THE
ACCOMPANYING SOFTWARE TO YOU ONLY IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS
IN THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT. PLEASE READ THE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE
YOU INSTALL THE SOFTWARE, BECAUSE BY INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE YOU
ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO
NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, LICENSOR WILL NOT LICENSE THIS SOFTWARE

OWNERSHIP OF THE SOFTWARE

1. The enclosed Licensor software program ("Software") and the
accompanying written materials are owned by Licensor or its suppliers
and are protected by United States copyright laws, by laws of other
nations, and by international treaties.


GRANT OF LICENSE

2. If you have purchased a per copy license to the Software, Licensor
grants to you the right to use one copy of the Software on a single
computer.  If the Software consists of multiple executable programs
then individually each of those executable programs can be used
only on a single computer, but there is no requirement that all
executables must be used on the same single computer.

3. If you have not yet purchased a license to the Software, Licensor
grants to you the right to use one copy of the Software on a single
computer for an evaluation period of 15 days.  If you wish to
continue using the Software and accompanying written materials
after the evaluation period, you must register the Software by
sending the required payment to Licensor. You will then receive a
license for continued use and a registration code that will permit
you to use the Software free of payment reminders. The Software
may come with extra programs and features that are available for
use only to registered users through the use of their registration
code.



RESTRICTIONS ON USE AND TRANSFER

4. You may distribute the Software and accompanying written materials
to others so long as all the files comprising the Software and
accompanying written materials are passed to the user without
modification and that a clear statement is made to the receiver of
the distribution that you are in no way transferring or assigning
rights to the Software.  The Licensor may revoke the right to
distribute the Software at any time, with or without cause, by
giving 30 days written notice to the distributor.

5. You may not distribute or transfer your registration code or
transfer the rights given by the registration code.

assign the right to use the Software.

to the Software and distribute the Software and registration codes
to those customers of the Reseller for which the Reseller has
purchased a license to the Software.  In these circumstances
registration codes will be issued in the name of the Resellers
customer or in such name as is separately, mutually agreed upon by
the Reseller and Licensor.

Software provided that they used only by users bound by this license.
