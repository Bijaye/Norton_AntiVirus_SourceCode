             Quick Start Guide to Immune System Gateway DNS records

  The example beneath assumes the following:

   * Two Immune System gateway arrays, each consisting of 
     seven machines;
   * The first will created in the domain 'gw01.dis.symantec.com',
     the second in 'gw02.dis.symantec.com'.

  Thus, the entries in the forward mapping file will look like this:

    gw01entry01.gw01.dis.symantec.com.     IN    A     X.X.X.1
    gw01inside01.gw01.dis.symantec.com.    IN    A     X.X.X.2
    gw01data01.gw01.dis.symantec.com.      IN    A     X.X.X.3
    gw01sample01.gw01.dis.symantec.com.    IN    A     X.X.X.4
    gw01def01.gw01.dis.symantec.com.       IN    A     X.X.X.5
    gw01def02.gw01.dis.symantec.com.       IN    A     X.X.X.6
    gw01def03.gw01.dis.symantec.com.       IN    A     X.X.X.7

    gw02entry01.gw02.dis.symantec.com.     IN    A     Y.Y.Y.1
    gw02inside01.gw02.dis.symantec.com.    IN    A     Y.Y.Y.2
    gw02data01.gw02.dis.symantec.com.      IN    A     Y.Y.Y.3
    gw02sample01.gw02.dis.symantec.com.    IN    A     Y.Y.Y.4
    gw02def01.gw02.dis.symantec.com.       IN    A     Y.Y.Y.5
    gw02def02.gw02.dis.symantec.com.       IN    A     Y.Y.Y.6
    gw02def03.gw02.dis.symantec.com.       IN    A     Y.Y.Y.7

  And the entries in the reverse mapping files will look like this:

    X.X.X.1.in-addr.arpa    IN   PTR  gw01entry01.gw01.dis.symantec.com.
    X.X.X.2.in-addr.arpa    IN   PTR  gw01inside01.gw01.dis.symantec.com.
    X.X.X.3.in-addr.arpa    IN   PTR  gw01data01.gw01.dis.symantec.com.
    X.X.X.4.in-addr.arpa    IN   PTR  gw01sample01.gw01.dis.symantec.com.
    X.X.X.5.in-addr.arpa    IN   PTR  gw01def01.gw01.dis.symantec.com.
    X.X.X.6.in-addr.arpa    IN   PTR  gw01def02.gw01.dis.symantec.com.
    X.X.X.7.in-addr.arpa    IN   PTR  gw01def03.gw01.dis.symantec.com.

    Y.Y.Y.1.in-addr.arpa    IN   PTR  gw02entry01.gw02.dis.symantec.com.
    Y.Y.Y.2.in-addr.arpa    IN   PTR  gw02inside01.gw02.dis.symantec.com.
    Y.Y.Y.3.in-addr.arpa    IN   PTR  gw02data01.gw02.dis.symantec.com.
    Y.Y.Y.4.in-addr.arpa    IN   PTR  gw02sample01.gw02.dis.symantec.com.
    Y.Y.Y.5.in-addr.arpa    IN   PTR  gw02def01.gw02.dis.symantec.com.
    Y.Y.Y.6.in-addr.arpa    IN   PTR  gw02def02.gw02.dis.symantec.com.
    Y.Y.Y.7.in-addr.arpa    IN   PTR  gw02def03.gw02.dis.symantec.com.

  [These records are shown in their unabbreviated form for clarity.
   One could, of course, set an origin, and then be able to use shorter
   forms throughout the rest of the file.  The reader is referred to
   the cricket book for more information.]

  Finally, the round robin record (in the forward mapping file) will
  look like this:

    gateways.dis.symantec.com.              IN    A     X.X.X.1
    gateways.dis.symantec.com.              IN    A     Y.Y.Y.1

  Of course, there is no reverse mapping entry for the round robin record.


             Detailed information on Immune System DNS requirements

Introduction

  As the reader will be aware, a major part of the functionality of the Immune
  System is provided by so-called 'gateways'.  Gateways form the bridge between
  the customer site, and the back office systems (in the form of the Analysis
  Centre, and manual processing within SARC).  A component of the Immune System
  software (known either as the Immune System Interface Agent [ISIA] or as
  IcePack) runs on the Quarantine Server machines within the client's
  organisation -- it is this component which talks to the Immune System
  gateways.

  Conversations between the Interface Agent and the gateways are protected by
  SSL, which provides both encryption (to protect data in transit from sniffing)
  and authentication (to provide an assurance that the Interface Agent is
  talking to a genuine gateway, as opposed to one controlled by a hacker and
  introduced to the Active Network via DNS poisoning or numerous similar attacks
  outside the scope of this document).

  It is this need for strong authentication which makes the requirement for the
  gateways' DNS entries to be strictly, and absolutely, correct.  The Immune
  System makes no demands on the DNS administrator which are outside the scope
  of standard DNS administration; however, in the case of the Immune System, it
  is more important for the administrator to correctly configure the DNS than it
  is in the case of (for example) Symantec's web and LiveUpdate servers.

  The purpose of this document is to provide basic instructions to the
  administrator (on how the DNS should be configured) and to the tester (on how
  to test that configuration).  It is assumed that the administrator has a
  working knowledge of DNS, and the tester has a basic knowledge.


DNS Basics

  DNS (Domain Name System) is the often described as the Internet's telephone
  directory.  This description is only partially accurate.  Like a telephone
  directory, DNS provides a mapping of names (www.bbc.co.uk) to numbers
  (38.160.150.31) -- this mapping is called the 'forward mapping'.  Unlike a
  telephone directory, DNS also provides a mapping of numbers (38.160.150.31) to
  names (www.bbc.co.uk) -- this mapping (called the 'reverse mapping') is not a
  property of any widely-available telephone directory of which the author is
  aware.

  In the case of a web or LiveUpdate server, it is possible for the
  administrator to get away with only providing the forward mapping, not the
  reverse mapping.  A good example of a case where this is the case is
  dropbox.symantec.com, which resolves (via the forward mapping) to
  198.6.49.231.  Unfortunately, there is no corresponding reverse mapping,
  connecting 198.6.49.231 back to dropbox.symantec.com.  Nonetheless,
  dropbox works fine as an FTP server -- however, it would not be suitable
  for use as an Immune System gateway.

  In the case of gateway machines, it is not possible for the DNS administrator
  to get away with not providing the reverse mapping.  Such an omission would
  cause clients to be unable to connect to gateway machines, and thus a complete
  loss of service to customers.


SSL primer

  In order to provide authentication, SSL utilises 'certificates'.  These are
  purchased from Verisign on a per machine basis (not per gateway -- for a seven
  machine gateway array, you will require one certificate for each machine
  running a web server -- usually six).  Certificates have the machine's DNS
  name stamped into them, and can only be use on a machine with the correct DNS
  name.

  It is important, therefore, that not only is DNS configured correctly, but
  also that the individual machines in the gateway arrays be configured with the
  correct DNS name at the operating system level.

  When the Interface Agent contacts a gateway, an SSL handshake sequence is
  performed.  As part of that sequence, the client checks to see that the server
  has a certificate which matches the DNS name which the client used to open the
  connection.  This is the authentication step.  The Interface Agent will
  terminate the conversation prior to the transaction if the names do not match.


Basic Immune System DNS and SSL certificate requirements

  Some of these requirements have been alluded to above; they will be restated,
  clarified, and enhanced here.

   * All machines in all arrays must have unique names.
   * It is required that all machines in all gateways have valid reverse
     DNS entries.  That is to say, it must be possible to go from the IP
     number to the DNS name.
   * It is required that all machines have the correct DNS name configured
     at the operating system level.
   * It is required that all machines running a web server have a valid
     SSL certificate which matches the correct DNS name.

  For example, consider the following set of mappings:

    entry.gateways.dis.symantec.com
       |               ^
       |               |
       +-> 10.10.10.1 -+

  This diagram shows a valid mapping for the entry point machine of a single
  gateway array.  Corresponding mappings must exist for other machines in the
  gateway array.  In the case of gateways consisting of only one machine, this
  mapping must exist for that machine.


Testing Basic Immune System DNS configuration

  A tool has been produced to assist with validation of DNS records for Immune
  System gateway machines.  This tool, called GWDNS.PL, should be used
  after the DNS administrator has installed the appropriate set of records on
  the DNS server.

  GWDNS.PL has its own, self-contained, perldoc documentation -- the tester
  should read those instructions before proceeding.  The tester will require a
  Windows NT or Windows 2000 computer 

  To validate the DNS records, the tester should do the following:

   * Make a list of the names of all gateway machines.  This includes
     all machines in all arrays, and all single-machine gateways.
   * Run GWDNS.PL, using this list as an argument.  For example,
     here the author ran gwdns.pl against all machines in a test
     gateway array [DNS names have been truncated for space]:

      C:\gw> gwdns.pl entry.iceberg sample1.iceberg definition1.iceberg
                      definition2.iceberg definition3.iceberg inside.iceberg

      Commencing DNS tests on 'entry.iceberg'.
        SUCCESS : entry.iceberg : Primary name     : entry.iceberg
        SUCCESS : entry.iceberg : IP address       : 9.2.70.17
          SUCCESS : 9.2.70.17 : Primary name     : entry.iceberg
          SUCCESS : 9.2.70.17 : Resolves back to : entry.iceberg

      Commencing DNS tests on 'sample1.iceberg'.
        SUCCESS : sample1.iceberg : Primary name     : sample1.iceberg
        SUCCESS : sample1.iceberg : IP address       : 9.2.70.20
          SUCCESS : 9.2.70.20 : Primary name     : sample1.iceberg
          SUCCESS : 9.2.70.20 : Resolves back to : sample1.iceberg

      Commencing DNS tests on 'definition1.iceberg'.
        SUCCESS : definition1.iceberg : Primary name     : definition1.iceberg
        SUCCESS : definition1.iceberg : IP address       : 9.2.70.21
          SUCCESS : 9.2.70.21 : Primary name     : definition1.iceberg
          SUCCESS : 9.2.70.21 : Resolves back to : definition1.iceberg

      Commencing DNS tests on 'definition2.iceberg'.
        SUCCESS : definition2.iceberg : Primary name     : definition2.iceberg
        SUCCESS : definition2.iceberg : IP address       : 9.2.70.22
          SUCCESS : 9.2.70.22 : Primary name     : definition2.iceberg
          SUCCESS : 9.2.70.22 : Resolves back to : definition2.iceberg

      Commencing DNS tests on 'definition3.iceberg'.
        SUCCESS : definition3.iceberg : Primary name     : definition3.iceberg
        SUCCESS : definition3.iceberg : IP address       : 9.2.70.23
          SUCCESS : 9.2.70.23 : Primary name     : definition3.iceberg
          SUCCESS : 9.2.70.23 : Resolves back to : definition3.iceberg

      Commencing DNS tests on 'inside.iceberg'.
        SUCCESS : inside.iceberg : Primary name     : inside.iceberg
        SUCCESS : inside.iceberg : IP address       : 9.2.70.18
          SUCCESS : 9.2.70.18 : Primary name     : inside.iceberg
          SUCCESS : 9.2.70.18 : Resolves back to : inside.iceberg

     The above output from GWDNS.PL indicates a successful run against a list of
     DNS names -- all names and numbers resolved correctly.

  If, in the GWDNS.PL test[s] shown above, any output lines are prefixed with
  'FAILED' instead of 'SUCCESS', the DNS configuration is inadequate.

  The tester should note that GWDNS.PL does not contact the gateways in any way.
  It simply uses DNS to obtain name and number information.  A successful test
  with GWDNS.PL does not mean that the tested machines will work as Immune
  System gateways, that the machines are correctly configured, or even that the
  gateway machines exist in any physical sense.


Round robin

  Like some telephone directories, DNS allows a single name to map to multiple
  addresses.  For example, the DNS name www.symantec.com resolves to six
  separate IP addresses -- 216.35.137.202, 208.226.167.17, 208.226.167.22,
  208.226.167.23, 216.35.137.200, and 216.35.137.201 (in no particular order).

  Furthermore, when a DNS server encounters this type of record, it will return
  the addresses in a different order each time.  This in turn affects which IP
  address the client will attempt to contact.  Usually, the client will contact
  the first address in the list of addresses it gets back, and so if the server
  returns the list in a different order each time, the effect is that of
  primitive load-balancing, and even more primitive fail-over.

  This type of record (a name mapping to more than on IP address) is referred to
  as a 'round robin' record.

  The Immune System allows (but IBM does not necessarily recommend) Symantec to
  use a round robin record to spread the load between multiple gateways.  If
  round robin is used, the DNS administrator must ensure that all the IP
  addresses have valid reverse mappings.


Round robin Immune System DNS and SSL certification requirements

  In addition to the requirements outlined above, in the case of
  a round robin configuration, the following additional item is
  required:

   * The name chosen for the round robin record must be a unique name,
     not the same as the name of any other machine.
   * Each IP address to which the round robin name maps must, in turn,
     resolve to a machine name which has only one IP address associated
     with it.

  For example, consider the following set of mappings:

   anotherentry.gateways.dis.symantec.com
      |
      +-> 10.10.10.1 -> entry.east.gateways.dis.symantec.com -+
      |        ^                                              |
      |        |                                              |
      |        +----------------------------------------------+
      |
      +-> 10.10.20.1 -> entry.west.gateways.dis.symantec.com -+
               ^                                              |
               |                                              |
               +----------------------------------------------+

  This diagram shows a valid configuration for a round robin gateway setup.
  'entry.gateways.dis.symantec.com' is a round robin DNS entry for the two IP
  addresses shown.  When a reverse lookup is performed on the two addresses, two
  new machine names are obtained.  When a forward lookup is done on each of
  these machine names, the correct IP address is returned for each.  This
  configuration is valid, as each individual entry point machine has a
  self-contained, valid, set of DNS records.  The round robin entry serves only
  to switch clients between the two available entry point machines.


Testing round robin Immune System DNS configuration

  In addition to tests outlined in the previous 'Testing...' section, 

   * Make another list of all the round robin names that will be used,
     and use GWDNS.PL to test these.  For example, here the author ran GWDNS.PL
     against a test round robin name [again, DNS names have been truncated for
     space]:

      C:\gw> gwdns.pl avis

      Commencing DNS tests on 'avis'.
        SUCCESS : avis : Primary name     : avis
        SUCCESS : avis : IP address       : 9.2.70.29
          SUCCESS : 9.2.70.29 : Primary name     : navajo
            SUCCESS : navajo : Primary name     : navajo
            SUCCESS : navajo : Resolves back to : 9.2.70.29
        SUCCESS : avis : IP address       : 9.2.70.17
          SUCCESS : 9.2.70.17 : Primary name     : entry.iceberg
            SUCCESS : entry.iceberg : Primary name     : entry.iceberg
            SUCCESS : entry.iceberg : Resolves back to : 9.2.70.17

     The about output from GWDNS.PL indicates a successful run against a single
     round robin name.  In this case, 'avis' resolves to two IP numbers (one of
     which is the entry-point machine in the gateway array used in the previous
     example), and both of those IP numbers resolve correctly.

  As with the previous test[s] -- if, in the GWDNS.PL test[s] shown above, any
  output lines are prefixed with 'FAILED' instead of 'SUCCESS', the DNS
  configuration is inadequate.


Conclusion

  Correct configuration of DNS records for Immune System gateway machines
  requires nothing which is out of the ordinary for a well-maintained DNS
  configuration database.  However, it requires more careful attention to
  correctness and detail than conventional server types.
