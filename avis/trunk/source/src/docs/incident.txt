General instructions

  Always remember the following:

    * Be specific, and relevant.  Provide as much information
      as possible about as many parts of the system as you
      can, in addition to all relevant log files.
    * Log files cannot be 'too large'.  Having said that, always
      ZIP them before emailing.


'On either side' ?!

  In a very coarse viewing, the Immune System looks like this:

    ISIA/QServer <----> Gateway <----> Analysis Centre <----> SDGS
  
  Thus, for each component, 'on either side' means:

    * ISIA/QServer      :   Gateway
    * Gateway           :   ISIA/QServer & Analysis Centre
    * Analysis Centre   :   Gateway      & SDGS
    * SDGS              :   Analysis Centre

Diagnostic information to be gathered

    * Log files from the component in which the incident
      manifested itself;
    * Log files from the components on either side of the
      affected component;
    * From the QServer machine:
        * Non-recursive ZIP archive of
            c:\program files\symantec\quarantine\server
          [The Quarantine Server installation directory]
        * ZIP archive of

          [The Central Quarantine directory]
        * Recursive registry dump of
            HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Symantec
    * From the Gateway machines:
        * ZIP archive of
            d:\avis
