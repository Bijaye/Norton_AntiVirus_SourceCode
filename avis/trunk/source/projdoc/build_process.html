<P>The purpose of this note is to specify the IBM Immune System build
and source code control procedures.  The contents of this note was
derived from the note describing the IBM AntiVirus 3.0 build and
source code control procedures.  We proceed to describe three issues:
source code control, build tree structure and process, and makefile
parameters and naming conventions.  The master copy of this document
is located in CMVC in the <B>projdoc</B> directory and is owned by the
CMVC component <B>build</B>.

<H2>Background: Languages</H2>

<P>Since we are reusing the build system from Version 3.0 of IBM
AntiVirus, the source code control and build process takes into
account various national languages.  Since no translation of the
Immune System is planned, we will only be using <B>ea</B> which stands
for American English.

<H2><A NAME="Source_Code_Control">Source Code Control</H2>

<P>The source code control system is called CMVC (Configuration
Management Version Control).  We plan to enable the notion of "tracks"
within CMVC.  This gives developers the ability to group multiple
files for functional changes and bug fixes as one -- e.g., we either
include all of the files necessary or none of the files.  In addition,
this enables us to spin builds regardless of the status of CMVC.

<P>Whenever a developer needs to modify code in response to a bug or
DCR (from the new Lotus Notes database), a "Defect" or "Feature" must
be opened by the developer against the appropriate CMVC component.
The developer should specify the Lotus Notes ID number as the comment
in their Defect or Feature.  Next, the developer chooses to accept the
Defect (or Feature) and then they create a "Track" which will be used
to associate all file changes required for this bug (or DCR).  At this
time, files can be locked by the developer and then changes are
checked in.  When a developer is finished making their changes, they
complete all the "Fix Records".  This automatically moves the state of
the track to "integrate".  At this point, the changed code is eligible
for inclusion in the next build.

<P>The first time a build starts, a level ("001") is created.  This
level contains all the files from the previous level plus those tracks
currently in the "integrate" state.  If the build finishes without
errors, then this level is committed.  If the build has errors, then
we fix them and respin an incremental build with only the files that
have been changed.  In essence, "001" represents the build number
in terms of builds that succeeded without errors.  Level manipulation
is reserved to the Hawthorne product builder.

<P>The structure of the CMVC components is as follows (subject to change):
<PRE>
    software
        immune_system_software
            avis_daemon
            avis_gui
            avis_servlets
            build
            avis_dataflow
            avis_clients
            avis_gateway
            avis_database
            avis_filter

    licensed_products

    products
        build
        package
        product_info

    resources

    test
</PRE>
<P>The CMVC client code can be found in \\avnetsrv\ftproot\tools\cmvc.
CMVC has four client products: "linux" for Linux, "os2" for OS/2,
"win16" for Windows 3.1, and "win32" for Windows 95, and Windows NT.

<H2>Build Process</H2>

<H3><A NAME="Build_Tree_Structure">Build Tree Structure </H3>

<P>The build tree listed below is the one that will be created on the
build machines.  The complete source files will be copied to each NT
build machine.  The build machines will only build those components
that need to be built on each respective machine.  The results will be
copied to a shared read-only LAN drive that developers can use to
build against.  The build process will be capable of iterating through
each makefile twice: once for release builds (production or ship) and
a second time for debug builds (to be used by developers when
debugging problems).

<P>The input (read-only) source trees obtained from CMVC will be structured as follows:
<PRE>
src
  build
  dataflow
  inc

utils
  w32

resdoc
  com
    inc
  ea
</PRE>
<P>The "src" tree contains all language independent code -- e.g., all
the C, CPP, and ASM files, most of the H files, etc.  The "resdoc"
tree contains items that the translation houses need to perform their
job, including resources, documentation, and help.  Its directory
structure is parallel to the "src" directory structure underneath each
language.  For those resource, documentation, and header files that
are common across all languages, a "common" subdirectory exists (with
parallel subdirectories). The "utils" tree contains locally developed
utilities that are needed for the build process -- e.g., "setcrc",
"pkzip", etc.

<P>The "src\inc" contains header files that are used to describe APIs
for various component libraries.  For instance, the header file
"mac.h" will be owned by the CMVC component "macros"; the header file
"vvr.h" will be owned by the CMVC component "vvr".

<P>The "src\incmak" contains make include files.  This is a centralized
location where developers may place their make include files -- e.g., if
a developer generates rules files that are common between multiple 
components.

<P>After the build completes, the following trees will also exist:
<PRE>
dobj
  ea

dlib
  ea

dout
  ea

robj
  ea

rlib
  ea

rout
  ea
    32
    nt

</PRE>
<P>Compiler output and scratch space for compilation (e.g., response
files) are placed in either "dobj" (debug) and "robj" (release) which
has subdirectories for each language (to handle in the worst case DOS
which needs to be recompiled for each language).  Below that, the
structure will be parallel to that of the "src" tree.  Similarly, the
contents of the "rlib" and "dlib" will be uniquely named libraries
that can be used by both developers and the build process for the
creation of DLLs and EXEs.

<P>The final results of the build process and the input for the
packaging process will be placed in the "dout" and "rout" directories
according to their language and platform name.  It is from these
directories that packaging will obtain its inputs and its outputs will
be placed somewhere (perhaps in "dpack" and "rpack" whose structure
will be determined at a later date).

<H3><A NAME="Naming_Conventions">Naming Conventions </H3>

<P>If we extend the list of six operating system platform codes (from
Ed Pring's "Trees of Trees" document) to take into account additional
target platforms, then we get the following table:
<PRE>
   Windows 32-bit (e.g., WinNT & Win95)         32
   Windows 32-bit Static Libraries              3S
   Windows NT                                   NT
   Windows NT Static Libraries                  NS
</PRE>
<P>The corresponding list of compilers follows:
<PRE>
   Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0                     V5
   Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0                     VC
</PRE>
<P>Within the intermediate object directory tree, if multiple
object/output directories are needed (e.g., for backend libraries), I
suggest that developers to utilize these naming conventions for those
subdirectories: "xxyy", where "xx" designates the compiler and "yy"
designates the target operating system.  For instance, the VVR
scratch/object directory for the ship (release) version of American
English using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 for Windows NT might have the
name "robj\ea\vvr\vcnt".

<P>For instance, the makefile used to build
the VVR library compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 for Windows NT
might have the filename "vvrvcnt.mak".

<H3><A NAME="Env_Vars_Defs">Environment Variables </H3>

<P>The following environment variables are defined to locate the base
(root directory) of various compilers and tools:

<DL COMPACT SIZE=15>
<DT><B>DEVSTD97 </B>
<DD>This points to the directory containing the Microsoft Visual
Studio 97 (which contains Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 Enterprise
Edition).
<DT><B>VISSTD60</B>
<DD>This points to the directory containing the Microsoft Visual
Studio 6.0 (which contains Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Enterprise
Edition).
<DT><B>xxDB2xx</B> 
<DD>Not defined yet... points to the directory containing the DB2
library and header files.
<DT><B>xxGOxx</B> 
<DD>Not defined yet... points to the directory containing the Lotus Go
server libraries and header files.
</DL>

<P>The following environment variables are set in the build process to
indicate different attributes about the build:

<DL COMPACT SIZE=15>
<DT><B>BLDDEBUG</B> 
<DD>If this environment variable is defined, then assume that a
debug build is occurring (e.g., extra tracing messages and/or less/no
optimization).  If it is not defined, then assume that a release build
is occuring.  
<DT><B>BLDOS</B> 
<DD>This contains "w32" which corresponds to the NT build operating system.
<DT><B>LANG1</B> 
<DD>This designates the language that is being built.  For the Immune System,
we will only be building "ea" (American English).
<DT><B>LANGTYPE </B> 
<DD>This designates whether the language is an "SBCS" or "DBCS"
language type. American English is an "SBCS" (single byte character
set) language.
<DT><B>LANGNAME </B> 
<DD>This designates which language is being built such as "T_LANG_EA"
for American English.  It might be useful to include this variable in
the CFLAGS of a makefile for a component that needs to know which
language is being compiled.
</DL>

<P>The following environment variables are defined to locate the
various build trees (all environment variables may include a drive
letter):

<DL COMPACT SIZE=15>
<DT><B>SRCD </B> 
<DD>This points to the root of the "src" tree. 
<DT><B>SRCDRIVE </B> 
<DD>This contains the drive letter and colon for the "src" tree.
<DT><B>UTILD </B> 
<DD>This points to the concatenation of the root of the "utils"
tree and the current build platform (e.g., "w32").
Developers can access locally produced utilities from this directory.
<DT><B>RESD </B> 
<DD>This points to the concatenation of the root of the "resdoc" tree
and the current build national language (LANG1).
<DT><B>RESDRIVE </B> 
<DD>This contains the drive letter and colon for the "resdoc" tree.
<DT><B>OBJD </B> 
<DD>This points to the concatenation of the root of the "robj" or
"dobj" tree (depending upon whether this is a debug build or a release
build) and the current build national language (LANG1).
<DT><B>OBJDRIVE </B> 
<DD>This contains the drive letter and colon for the appropriate object tree.
<DT><B>LIBD </B> 
<DD>This points to the concatenation of the root of the "rlib" or
"dlib" tree (depending upon whether this is a debug build or a release
build) and the current build national language (LANG1).
<DT><B>OUTD </B> 
<DD>This points to the concatenation of the root of the "rout" or
"dout" tree (depending upon whether this is a debug build or a release
build) amd the current build national language (LANG1).
</DL>

<P>To more easily support developer builds, five additional
environment variables are defined that will most likely include a
drive letter.  These variables will be used when the above xxxD
variables are pointing to various directories on a local developers
machine.  In the section of this document on Makefiles, I will
describe how these variables are used:

<DL COMPACT SIZE=15>
<DT><B>BLDSRC </B> 
<DD>This points to the root of the "src" tree from a build on the LAN.
<DT><B>BLDLIB </B> 
<DD>This points to the base of the appropriate "rlib" or "dlib" tree
from a build on the LAN. 
<DT><B>BLDRES </B> 
<DD>This points to the concatenation of the root of the "resdoc" tree
and the current build national language from a build on the LAN.
<DT><B>VCLIB </B> 
<DD>This contains a list of directories that should be searched for
libraries.  It is in a syntax that is appropriate for the Microsoft
Visual C++ Linker ("PATHNAME1;PATHNAME2"). 
<DT><B>INCPATHS </B> 
<DD>This contains a list of directories that should be searched for
header files. Similarly, its purpose is to simplify makefiles.
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="Makefiles">Makefiles </H3>

<P>The build process consists of multiple passes.  Each pass should
continue regardless of the errors that are generated.  Makefile
execution errors (compilation, linking, etc.)  should be printed on
the console (e.g., either standard output or standard error).  If a
makefile does not require one of these passes, then its makefile
should still have the appropriate target -- it just does not do
anything:
<OL COMPACT>
<LI>This "make clean" pass ("clean" is the target name) is used to erase
the appropriate files for the current build national language.

<LI>This "make depend" pass is used to generate the dependencies for
the various targets. It can also be used to create the appropriate
output directories and/or to copy the source files to the "robj" (or
"dobj") working directories.

<LI>This "make compile" pass is used to compile the C, CPP, and ASM files
into OBJ files and to compile resource RC files into RES with the
resource compiler.  Depending upon whether this is a release or debug
spin, the results will be placed in the appropriate "robj" or "dobj"
directory.

<LI>This "make library" pass is used to generate the libraries using the
object files.  Similarly, depending upon whether this is a release or
debug spin, the results will be placed in the appropriate "rlib" or
"dlib" directory.  No mixed National Language libraries are permitted
(e.g., all objects for a particular library must come from the same
national language).

<LI>This "make help" pass is used for building help and documentation --
essentially things that will be translated for specific language
versions.

<LI>This "make exedll" pass is used to build the executables and DLLs from
the libraries and a minimal number of object files.  In general, all
executables and DLLs should be built from libraries.  This will be
discussed in further detail below.
</OL>

<P>Packaging occurs after the build process finishes -- the actual
process will be determined later.

<P>Under no circumstances should any file be written or modified in
the "src" or "resdoc" trees.  The developer is provided with space for
objects, response files, etc. in the OBJD tree and is expected to
generate any appropriate subdirectories.  At a minimum, the
appropriate root directory must be created.  For example, to find the
working location for creating the "vvr" objects for Microsoft Visual
C++ 5.0 for Windows NT, the "vvr" developer could set for an internal
makefile variable called OBJ as follows: OBJ = $(OBJD)/vvr/vcnt

<H3>Makefile Invocation Examples</H3>

<P>If we were compiling in American English ("ea"), then all language
variables would be set to "ea".

<H3>Easier Development using the Same Makefile as Build</H3>

<P>To permit easier development of executables and DLLs on a
developers workstation, we uge the them to include the following
environment variables in your search paths for header files and
libraries.  Please note that I have also expanded out the current
proposed definition for each of these variables:
<PRE>
INCPATHS=-I$(SRCD)\inc -I$(RESD)\..\com\inc -I$(BLDSRC)\inc -I$(BLDRES)\..\com\inc
VCLIB=$(LIBD)\..\$(LANG1);$(BLDLIB)\..\$(LANG1)
</PRE>
<P>Lets looks at the advantages of this approach in terms of three cases:
<OL COMPACT>
<LI>When the production build runs, the BLDLIB, BLDSRC, and BLDRES will
be set to the values LIBD, SRCD, and RESD, respectively.  Hence, the
statement above has no impact.

<LI>If I am a GUI (or front-end developer), then I can set up my local
environment to one that parallels the build environment.  In addition,
I can choose a build on the LAN and set the environment variables
BLDLIB, BLDSRC, and BLDRES to point to the appropriate trees.  When I
want to link a new GUI program with the backend libraries from the
LAN, the linker will first search the local machine for the libraries
and secondly search the LAN.

<LI>If I am a backend developer, then I can also set up my local
environment to one to one that parallels the build environment.  I can
build a GUI that uses my backend library by first rebuilding my
library and secondly rebuilding the GUI on my local machine.  During
the second step, the GUI makefile will first search for its libraries
locally and secondly from the LAN.
</OL>

<H3><A NAME="Env_Var_Settings"> Environment Variable Settings for
American English Build </H3>

<P>For illustration purposes, assume that the C drive on the build
machines contains both the operating system and the build (compiler
and other utilities) tools and that the D drive contains the build
input and outputs for release avis100 and level 010.  For an American
English release (ship) build, the following environment variables
would be set:
