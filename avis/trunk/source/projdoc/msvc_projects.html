<P>CMVC builds are based on environment variables at any given time. MSVC++ 4.x, 5.0 doesn't always allow you to specify environment variables in places, where normal human would want them to be. Following document describes how to use MSVC++ environment and still be compatible with CMVC build process. Following is a description of sequence of actions and "tweaks" to make things work. I giving the example of how I setted up TCPIPNET project. TCPIPNET is a part of NTSHIELD. You just have to substitute names to the ones that right for your project. </P>

<PRE>
1. Create project workspace, include all files, make sure compiler,
   linker and all other settings are whatever you want them to be.

2. Go to: Build-Settings-General-Intermediate files

3. Make sure that on the left side of dialog *both* Debug and Release are selected.

4. Type: ///OBJD///\ntshield\tcpipnet

5. In Build-Settings-General-Output files  type: 

       ///OUTD///\nt

   Note: 1. Normal human programmer would love to put $(OBJD) and $(OUTD) over
&#9;    there, but Microsoft thinks differently. ///xxxx/// will be converted to
&#9;    $(xxxx) by the TWEAKMAK.EXE utility, that I wrote. This will be done
&#9;    automatically.
&#9; 2. Use: ///OUTD///\.  - ("\." appended) if you don't have actual
&#9;    directory to append. (MSVC++ don't like path to ends with '///').

6. Go to: Build-Settings-C/C++-General
   On a left pane select only "debug" build. That will allow you to edit
   "Project options" edit field. Goto "Project Options" edit field.
   Erase from there one-by-one compiler settings, starting with:
   /Fp /Fo and /Fd
   Each of these will look like: /Fp"///OBJD///\ntshield\virscan/virscan.pch"
   You have to erase it, because every time you changing compiler settings
   directly MSVC++ by mistake adds the second copy of these /F...  settings.
   MSVC++ would cleanly recreate them every time anyway, so don't worry.
   Just don't erase anything extra.
   (In fact same problem happening with the linker setting, if you'd decide to
    edit it directly. For linker settings you'd have to erase:
    /PDB  /DEF  /OUT  /IMPLIB  /MAP).

7. Add: $(INCPATHS) right before final '/c'.

8. Do the same (6, 7) for release build. Unfortunately it has to be
   done separately, because you cannot edit project settings if both
   debug and release builds are hilited on a left pane.

9. Make sure that on the left side of dialog *both* Debug and Release are selected.
   Go to: Build-&gt;Settings-&gt;C/C++-&gt;Preprocessor.
   Add:  $(LANGTYPE)

10. Go to: Build-&gt;Settings-&gt;Link-&gt;Object/Library modules:
    Add:  $(LIBD)\dbcsvcnt.lib

11. Copy %UTILD%\im_templ.cmd  to your project directory and rename it to,
   say, M.CMD

12. M.CMD will be used to build your project.

13. Edit M.CMD as per description in it. Its very small and easy
    change.

14. Create a makefile: NTSHVCNT.MAK (use name, appropriate to
    you project) with the following content:

<B><FONT COLOR="#008000">#-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Makefile begins.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------

depend:
    cd $(SRCD)\ntshield\tcpipnet
    $(SRCDRIVE)
    m.cmd depend

compile:
    cd $(SRCD)\ntshield\tcpipnet
    $(SRCDRIVE)
    m.cmd compile

help:
    cd $(SRCD)\ntshield\tcpipnet
    $(SRCDRIVE)
    m.cmd help

library:
    cd $(SRCD)\ntshield\tcpipnet
    $(SRCDRIVE)
    m.cmd library

exedll:
    cd $(SRCD)\ntshield\tcpipnet
    $(SRCDRIVE)
    m.cmd exedll

all:
    cd $(SRCD)\ntshield\tcpipnet
    $(SRCDRIVE)
    m.cmd all

clean:
    cd $(SRCD)\ntshield\tcpipnet
    $(SRCDRIVE)
    m.cmd clean

#-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Makefile ends.

15. That's it. You project should be ready for the IBMAV build process.
    All above hassle is needed if you want MSVC++ environment to
    generate and maintain you MDP and MAK files and all settings in it,
    and be compatible with CMVC build process  vs. writing your own
    makefile for every NT project.  If you need to change other settings
    in your project later on - just load "Project Workspace", change
    settings you want, then close it and check it into CMVC.</PRE>
