Due to the NT security issues with the System scheduler we would not be able to run
a regular exe application with access to all windows resources. The mechanism
of invoking an exe(runsched) which runs another process would not work because
- the security lear creates a shell with restricted access, thus way for
example NT does not allow our application to use the GlobalAtom table and we
GPF.

A solution which comes to this is a simple service app which will pipe connect to the
requester and it will execute the piped command line. The services have security
privilege to create a process with no restriction to the windows resources.

Note: this is just a remainder in a case we want to prossed in this direction and
then we could start from were we left the above problem. The above observation and
suggested designee is not fully complete, better ideas are welcome.
