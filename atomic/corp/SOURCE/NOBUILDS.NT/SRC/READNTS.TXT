Microsoft Office 2000 File Extensions
-------------------------------------
Norton AntiVirus now recognizes the new Microsoft Office 2000 file
extensions, and will readily scan these new file types. The following
extensions were added to the initial and default Program Files
extension list:

	HTM*, HTT, VBS, JS and SHS

Reboot necessary after modifying some options
---------------------------------------------
In the "Program File Extensions" dialog (in the NAV Options dialog
under either the Scanner or AutoProtect tabs), if you make any
modifications to the entries or toggle the "Check files without
extensions" checkbox, you will need to restart Windows for the
changes to take effect.

New configuration options for network administrators
----------------------------------------------------
We have added administration features that expand the configuration
options available.  Many configuration options can now be accessed
more easily, and LiveUpdates and virus scans can now be randomly
scheduled.

This release also includes more robust Scan and Deliver and alerting
functions.

    Randomizing Live Update and Virus Scan schedules:
       This feature is documented in the NPSCHED.INI file.

    Registry Keys of Interest
       CAUTION: The entries in this section assume that you have a
       working knowledge of the Windows Registry Editor, RegEdit.
       Improper use of RegEdit can result in system malfunction.

       * Skipping the Shutdown Scan
       ----------------------------
       Some laptop computers with swappable floppy drives will hang
       if the floppy drive is not present on shutdown if Scan on
       Shutdown is in force.

       A new registry key will override the configuration setting
       and always skip the shutdown scan, even if re-enabled by the
       user through the NAV options panels.

       To create this key, use the Windows registry editor to find
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Symantec
             \Norton AntiVirus\Auto-Protect

       Add a new String value under that key, naming it
       SkipShutdownScan.  Assign it a value of "1".

       To install NAV with this option pre-configured (for use in
       network distributions to users):

             1) Edit INSTOPTS.INI
             2) In the [Skip Shutdown Scan] section, ensure that
                SkipShutdownScan=1 is not commented out

       * Disabling the Scheduler Prompt during installation
       ----------------------------------------------------
       After running LiveUpdate a dialog is presented that asks the
       user to schedule a scan session in the future.  By manually
       setting a registry key during or after installation the dialog
       will be disabled.

       Using the Windows Registry Editor (RegEdit), find

       \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Symantec\Norton AntiVirus
             \LiveUpdate\ShowScheduleAddDialog

       Set the value associated with this key to "0" if you want the
       dialog disabled (default value), or "1" to enable it.

       To install NAV with this option pre-configured (for use in
       network distributions to users):

             1) Edit INSTOPTS.INI
             2) In the [LUScheduleDlg] section, ensure that
                DisableLUSchedule=[0 or 1] is not commented out

       * Disabling scanning attempts for HPFS volumes on NT
       ----------------------------------------------------

       When running NAV NT on WinNT 4.0 workstation or server that
       has an HPFS partition, NAV sees the partition as being
       'locked' by a disk utility.  This is because the OS cannot
       read HPFS drives without special drivers.

       We have added a new registry key which tells NAV to ignore
       these partitions, even though NT reports that the drive
       letter exists.

       This error occurs because by default, all hard drives on a
       system are selected for scanning by NAV. The issue is that
       the operating system doesn't natively support HPFS drives and
       cannot access them, even though it can 'see' them and will
       display them in Explorer (or to other applications). NAV, upon
       touching the drive, interprets this as the drive being
       'locked' and reports this as an error.

       To alleviate this issue, simply double-click the SkpLkDrv.reg
       file from the folder which contains Norton AntiVirus (by
       default, C:\Program Files\Norton AntiVirus\).  This will
       configure NAV to ignore volumes which cannot be accessed by
       Windows NT.

       To install NAV with this option pre-configured (for use in
       network distributions to users):

             1) Edit INSTOPTS.INI
             2) In the [HPFS Error Message] section, ensure that
                SkipLockedDrvMsg=[0 or 1] is not commented out

       * Skipping message box when attempting to scan 
         unavailable drive.
       ----------------------------------------------
       Prior to this release, if a scheduled or a command-line scan 
       was set to scan a drive which is not available at the time 
       of the scan, a message box would be displayed, halting 
       further scans and requiring user interaction to continue.

       While this is still the default operation of the product, 
       you can disable the message box from appearing by setting 
       the registry key:

       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Symantec\Norton AntiVirus 
            \IgnoreDriveLockedMessage       
       
       to a value of =DWORD:00000001.  This can also be 
       accomplished by executing the SKPLKDRV.REG file from the 
       Norton AntiVirus folder.  

       When this registry key is set, there will be no error message 
       displayed, and the Activity Log will be updated to reflect 
       that the drive was skipped during the scanning process.

    Building the latest Virus definitions into an install set:
       We have changed the format of our install set.  Now, all
       virus definition files are stored in expanded format in their
       own folders.  This will allow administrators to copy in the
       latest virus definitions prior to placing the install set on
       a network server for rollout to users.

       There are two different ways of inserting virus definitions into
       the NAV 5.02.02 install sets.  Both involve an understanding of
       the differences between the two types of virus definitions NAV
       uses, and how those definition sets are updated through NAV's
       LiveUpdate module.

       NAV Definition Types
       The two types of sets are called "hubs" and "microdefs."  A
       "hub" can be considered the "master list" of all definitions.
       Hubs are released once per month by SARC.  By design, Norton
       AntiVirus must ship with and install using a hub definition set.

       Microdefs can be considered a "differential" definition set,
       covering only the byte-for-byte changes since the prior hub
       was released.  This is for the most part what is rolled out
       through LiveUpdate packages, and is the reason why they are
       comparatively much smaller (only 100-200Kb on average versus
       2Mb for a full hub).

       Since, for the most part, file names and numbers of files are
       the same between hub and microdef sets, it is impossible to tell
       the difference between them by simply looking at a file listing.

       We have added functionality in NAV 5.02.02 to allow
       administrators to roll out NAV with not only hub sets but
       updated microdef sets as well.  We are using new HubDef and
       MicroDef folders to accomplish this.

       Replacing Virus Definitions
       There are two stages of replacement, depending on how far the
       user or administrator wishes to go.  The first method involves
       only updating the install set with the latest hub.  Because
       hubs are updated on a monthly basis, this means that virus
       definitions may be up to a month old.

       The second stage builds on the first stage, adding the latest
       microdef set.  This will update the install set with definitions
       that are a few days to a few weeks old, depending on the date of
       installation and the date of latest microdef release.

       Important Note: All virus definition sets are "platform-
       sensitive".  Windows 9x and Windows NT Intel platforms use a
       shared set, and Windows NT Dec Alpha uses a different set.  You
       must repeat the following steps for each of the two platform
       types (Intel and DecAlpha).

       Stage 1 - Hub Definitions Replacement
       1. On a machine representing the platform whose install set
          you wish to update (for example: Windows 9x), LiveUpdate
          continually until you are told there are no new updates
          to download.
       2. Open an Explorer window, and browse to the
          \Program Files\Common Files\Symantec Shared\VirusDefs folder.
       3. Open a second Explorer window and create a temporary folder.
       4. Copy the contents of both the VirusDefs\BinHub and
          VirusDefs\TextHub folders into the temporary folder you
          created.  This folder contains the "hub" set.  The date of
          the hub corresponds to the date on the files.  Make a note
          of these file dates, as you will need to refer back to them
          if you proceed to Stage 2 below.
       5. In the 5.02.02 install set, delete the contents of the HubDef
          folder, leaving the folder empty.
       6. Copy the hub set from step 4 into the HubDef folder of the
          NAV 5.02.02 install set(s) that corresponds to the platform
          on which you downloaded the definitions.  In the example in
          step 1, these definitions would be used in the Windows 9x,
          Windows NT Server and Windows NT workstation products for
          Intel platforms.
       7. If you are not going to proceed with Stage 2, delete the
          MicroDef folder from the NAV 5.02.02 install set.

       Stage 2 - Microdef Replacement
       Note: Do not perform this stage until you have first completed
       Stage 1 above.

       This stage shows administrators how to add a new microdef set
       in addition to a hub set that they have already replaced in
       Stage 1 above.  Microdefs are stored in the MicroDef folder
       in the install set.  Just as with hub definitions, microdefs
       are platform sensitive.

       1. On the machine used in step 1 of stage 1 above, look again at
          the VirusDefs folder.  In it you will see folders that are
          named with a series of numbers.  These numbers correspond
          to the date of the latest microdef set downloaded, in the
          format yyyymmdd.xxx, where xxx represents an ordinal number
          (usually 001 but can be different).
       2. Find the folder representing the latest date that is also
          later than the date of your Hub definition set. Use the name
          of the folder to determine the date, and not the conventional
          folder datestamp, as they usually will not correspond.
          If there is no folder that is newer than your hub set, then
          the hub set is the latest definition set and there are not
          currently any microdefs that are newer.  In this case, do
          not proceed any further with this stage.
       3. In the NAV 5.02.02 install set, delete the contents of the
          MicroDef folder, leaving it empty.
       4. Copy the contents of the folder from step 2 into the MicroDef
          folder in the install set (again, pay attention to the
          platform you're using).
       5. You have now created a new install set, complete with both
          the latest hub and the latest microdefs.  When installed,
          the [Info] dialog should report the latest definition date.

       Points of interest: Our installer automatically performs a date
       check, comparing the definitions in the HubDef folder of the
       install set with those in the MicroDef folder.  Unless the
       MicroDef folder contains newer definitions then the HubDef
       folder, MicroDef will be ignored.  This is done to prevent a
       situation where a user would copy a new hub set into the HubDef
       folder, but forget to delete or update the MicroDef folder.

       We also test for the presence of the MicroDef folder.  If
       MicroDef doesn't exist, only the hub set in HubDef will be
       installed and there will be no errors reported.

Installing on systems equipped with Norton Utilities, Your Eyes Only
or Norton AntiVirus 4.0x
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you install Norton AntiVirus on a system which has Norton Utilities
for NT version 2.0, Norton Your Eyes Only for NT, or Norton AntiVirus
4.0x installed, you may get an "Unable to start NAVAP" message at the
end of installation.  Norton Utilities 2.0 and Norton Your Eyes Only use
some drivers that Norton AntiVirus will replace, and a reboot is
necessary to complete installation.  NOTE:Norton AntiVirus AutoProtect
will not be active until the system has been rebooted.

Print versions of Norton AntiVirus Guides
-----------------------------------------
Print versions of the Norton AntiVirus User and Implementation Guides
can be ordered through Symantec Customer Service.

Uninstalling LiveUpdate
-----------------------
Because LiveUpdate is shared among Symantec products, it is not
uninstalled automatically if you select Uninstall Norton AntiVirus.

To uninstall LiveUpdate, choose Add/Remove Programs from the Windows
Control Panel and select LiveUpdate.

Removing Norton AntiVirus from the Windows Start menu
-----------------------------------------------------
If Uninstall does not remove the Norton AntiVirus program group from
the Windows Start menu, you must remove it manually. To remove the
program group, right-click the taskbar, select Properties, click the
Start Menu Programs tab, click Remove, select Norton AntiVirus, and
then click Remove.

Options settings from earlier versions of Norton AntiVirus
----------------------------------------------------------
Options settings from versions 4.0 and earlier of Norton AntiVirus are
not preserved when you install Norton AntiVirus 5.0.

Quarantining non-deletable files
--------------------------------
Norton AntiVirus cannot quarantine non-deletable files (for example,
files infected by the DirII virus). To manually add these types of
files to the Quarantine, open the Quarantine and choose Add Item.

Installing Norton AntiVirus and Microsoft Outlook 98
----------------------------------------------------
If Microsoft Outlook 98 is running during Norton AntiVirus
installation, the install will take a long time. Close Microsoft
Outlook 98 before installing Norton AntiVirus.

Novell NetWare: Installing from long filename (LFN) directories
---------------------------------------------------------------
Norton AntiVirus cannot be installed from long filename (LFN)
directories under Novell NetWare.

Installing Norton AntiVirus and Lotus Notes Server
--------------------------------------------------
You must first stop the Lotus Notes Server before installing Norton
AntiVirus. The setup program will not run while Lotus Notes Server
is running.

Access privileges required for installation
-------------------------------------------
As part of Norton AntiVirus installation, shared Symantec files, which
are components of all Symantec products, are always installed to
\Program Files\Symantec -- even if a custom location for the Norton
AntiVirus program files is specified during install. If you do not
have write (and create, if necessary) privileges to this location,
the install will fail.

Short File Name (SFN) alias generation during install
-----------------------------------------------------
If you are installing Norton AntiVirus to a custom location that is
a Long File Name (LFN) folder, SFN alias generation must not be
disabled during the install. To re-enable SFN alias generation, run
REGEDT32 and change the following registry key entry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem

  NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation should be set to 0 to enable SFN
  alias generation.

You must restart your NT machine in order for changes in SFN alias
generation to take effect. Set the value back to 1 after installation
to disable SFN alias generation, if desired.

Using the /INTERACTIVE switch with the AT command to schedule scans
-------------------------------------------------------------------
You must use the /INTERACTIVE switch to schedule scans with the AT
command. If NAVWNT is launched from the NT Scheduling Service (AT)
without the /INTERACTIVE switch, Norton AntiVirus remains in memory
with no way of terminating. The following examples demonstrate
correct usage to schedule automatic scans three times per week.

For Windows NT 4.0:

 at 17:30 /interactive /every:M,W,F "c:\Program Files\NAVNT\navwnt" /L

See your Windows NT documentation for more information on using the AT
command.

Installation from long-filename folders on NetWare servers
----------------------------------------------------------
On a Novell NetWare server, you cannot install Norton AntiVirus from
a long-filename folder.

Creating a test text file that looks like a virus
-------------------------------------------------
To create a harmless text file that will be detected as a virus,
which you can then use to verify detection of viruses, logging and
functioning of alerts, copy the following line in to a separate file,
saving it as trigger.com. This file is NOT a virus, but will be
detected as the "EICAR Test String.68" virus. Disable Auto-Protect
temporarily before you save the file.

X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

Using Netscape with Norton AntiVirus
------------------------------------
If Norton AntiVirus is installed as a Netscape helper application, a
a downloaded file will be lost if Netscape is closed before the
download is complete.

Changing LiveUpdate automatic schedules
---------------------------------------
By default, the first time that LiveUpdate completes a successful
session, it offers to schedule future sessions automatically. If you
want to modify or delete the scheduled sessions, access the Norton
Program Scheduler from the Norton AntiVirus group on the Start menu
or the Norton AntiVirus main window.

Uninstalling Norton NT Tools
----------------------------
If Norton NT Tools is uninstalled after Norton AntiVirus is installed,
the shared file S32STAT.DLL is removed. Reinstall Norton AntiVirus to
correct the problem.

Preventing the Norton AntiVirus Startup Logo Screen from displaying
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Some users prefer not to see the startup logo screens that display
when Norton AntiVirus components are loaded. They can be disabled
adding the following Registry entries:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Symantec\Norton AntiVirus\Auto-Protect]
"DisableSplashScreen"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Symantec\Norton AntiVirus NT\Clinic]
"DisableSplashScreen"=dword:00000001

Quarantining Multi-stream Files
-------------------------------
The Norton AntiVirus Windows NT Scanner quarantines multi-stream files
(for example, Macintosh files) on an NTFS volume. On a FAT volume, the
Norton AntiVirus Windows NT Scanner will only quarantine the
multi-stream file's default stream.

Auto-Protect will only quarantine a multi-stream file's default stream
on both NTFS and non-NTFS volumes.

Long Filenames and LiveUpdate
-----------------------------
Long Filenames (LFNs) must be enabled on Windows NT systems to
install LiveUpdate.

Network application performance issues with AutoProtect running
---------------------------------------------------------------
AutoProtect by default, opens files on a network drive in shared mode.
This can increase the time it takes for an application to load over
the network. To speedup load time of applications, you can configure
Auto-Protect to open files in non-shared mode. To do this,
double-click the APNTFAST.REG file located in the Norton AntiVirus
folder, then restart your computer.

If sharing violations occur after setting AutoProtect to non-shared
mode, reset Auto-Protect to shared mode. To do this, double-click the
APNTNORM.REG file, then restart your computer.

IRPStackSize
------------
When you install Norton AntiVirus for NT, your registry setting for
IRPStacksize should not change.

If the setting does not already exist, our installer will create it with
a setting size of 6.  If the setting does exist, but is below 6, our
installer will increment it to 6.  If the setting does exist, but is 6
or higher, but below 11, our installer will increment it by 2.  If the
setting does exist, but is already at 11 or 12, our installer will not
touch it.

If you are having difficulties starting the NAV AP services, increment the
IRPStacksize by 2 and restart.

Please note that 12 is the maximum allowed by the operating system.

If you uninstall Norton AntiVirus for NT and it is the last Symantec
product that uses symevent.sys, we will normally decrement that setting
by 2, down to a level of 6. We check a usage count first to determine
if we are the "last out."

This setting is required by the operating system and is related to I/O devices
and device filters. Not having this set high enough can negatively impact the
loading of the NAV AutoProtect. It can also negatively impact access to
devices such as CDRoms. It can also negatively impact applications that are
I/O intensive.

Internet access problems with LiveUpdate
----------------------------------------
LiveUpdate operation may be restricted because of firewalls or proxy
servers.  Contact your network administrator if you have problems
using LiveUpdate due to your network security policy.

Additional information for system administrators
------------------------------------------------
If you're a system administrator and would like information about
Norton AntiVirus Administration Tools or other Corporate products,
please visit our website at:

    http://www.symantec.com/solutions/navcorp.html

Activity Log "Access Denied Errors" option
------------------------------------------
The Activity Log includes a new option to report attempts to scan when
access is denied.  For example, an administrator may try to scan a
folder to which you have prevented others from accessing by setting
access permissions.  Norton AntiVirus will report in the Activity Log
that an attempt was made to scan your restricted-access folder.

Online manuals: "Cannot find or run file" error message
-------------------------------------------------------
You must install Adobe Acrobat Reader to view the Norton AntiVirus
online manuals.

To install Adobe Acrobat Reader:

  1 On the Windows Taskbar, click Start, point to Programs,
    point to Norton AntiVirus, and click Norton AntiVirus to open
    the Norton AntiVirus main window.

  2 From the Help menu, point to Product Support Online, and click
    Product Support.

  3 In the Product Support help window that appears, click
    Install Adobe Acrobat Reader.

Rename Error during Norton AntiVirus installation
-------------------------------------------------

If you experience a Comctl32.dll rename error when installing
Norton AntiVirus, an error dialog box on your screen shows
the following information:

    RENAME ERROR

    An error occurred renaming a file "Cannot create a file when
    that file already exists"(error #183).

    Current File Name: C:\WINNT\System32\Comctl32.dll
    New File Name: C:\WINNT\System32\comctl32.bak

To fix the Comctl32.dll rename error:
