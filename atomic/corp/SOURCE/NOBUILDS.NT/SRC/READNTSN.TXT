Print versions of Norton AntiVirus Guides
-----------------------------------------
Print versions of the Norton AntiVirus User and Implementation Guides
can be ordered through Symantec Customer Service.

Options settings from earlier versions of Norton AntiVirus
----------------------------------------------------------
Options settings from earlier versions of Norton AntiVirus are not
preserved when you install Norton AntiVirus 4.0.  The new version
stores options settings in a different format.

Installing Norton AntiVirus and Lotus Notes Server
--------------------------------------------------
You must first stop the Lotus Notes Server before installing Norton
AntiVirus. The setup program will not run while Lotus Notes Server
is running.

NT 4.0 Service Pack 2
---------------------
There is a serious incompatibility issue between AutoProtect and
Service Pack 2 that may cause your NT machine to crash. This may
occur when mounting CD-ROM's, or when formatting a floppy.  You
should install Service Pack 3 instead.  Service Pack 3 is available
from the following FTP site:

ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/jpn/NT40/sp3/nec98

NT 3.51 Service Pack 4 and uninstalling Norton AntiVirus
--------------------------------------------------------
There is a known bug in SMSS.EXE in Service Pack 4 that prevents easy
uninstall and reinstall of Norton AntiVirus. Microsoft and Symantec
recommend that you upgrade this file. 

To upgrade the file, rename SMSS.EXE to SMSS.ORG in your Windows NT
system32 subdirectory, copy the updated SMSS.EXE from the Norton
AntiVirus install disk to your system32 subdirectory, then restart
Windows NT. Do not apply this fix unless you are running NT 3.51
Service Pack 4. 
 
Restart desirable after installing for the first time
-----------------------------------------------------
After you install Norton AntiVirus you should restart your machine or
restart the server software. The install process modifies two registry
keys that will not take effect until you do so. 

To restart the server software:

   1) Open an MS-DOS box, and type the following at the command prompt:

      NET STOP SERVER

      This will log all connected users and machines off, and stop the 
      "Net Logon" service and the "Computer Browser" service.

   2) Restart the stopped services by typing the following: 

      NET START SERVER
      NET START "Net Logon"
      NET START "Computer Browser"

      This returns your machine to full operation, with the modified
      settings in the registry in place.

The two settings modified by install are the following:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\
LanmanServer\Parameters

The modified values are:

CachedOpenLimit = 0
IrpStackSize = 2 more than what it was, or 6 if no value was present

The first change ensures that files are promptly scanned on the
server when they are closed. This change only affects NT servers.

The second change tells the system to increase the I/O request packet
stack size to allow for the presence of NAV's file filter driver. If
this isn't done, you may get the message "not enough memory to
complete the operation" when attaching to a CD-ROM share from a
remote machine. 

Access privileges required for installation
------------------------------------------- 
As part of Norton AntiVirus installation, shared Symantec files, which
are components of all Symantec products, are always installed to 
\win32app\symantec under Windows NT 3.51 or to \Program Files\Symantec
under Windows NT 4.0 -- even if a custom location for the Norton 
AntiVirus program files is specified during install. If you do not
have write (and create, if necessary) privileges to this location, 
the install will fail.

Short File Name (SFN) alias generation during install
-----------------------------------------------------
If you are installing Norton AntiVirus to a custom location that is
a Long File Name (LFN) folder, SFN alias generation must not be 
disabled during the install. To re-enable SFN alias generation, run 
REGEDT32 and change the following registry key entry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem

  NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation should be set to 0 to enable SFN 
  alias generation.

You must restart your NT machine in order for changes in SFN alias
generation to take effect. Set the value back to 1 after installation
to disable SFN alias generation, if desired.

Using the /INTERACTIVE switch with the AT command to schedule scans
-------------------------------------------------------------------
You must use the /INTERACTIVE switch to schedule scans with the AT
command. If NAVWNT is launched from the NT Scheduling Service (AT)
without the /INTERACTIVE switch, Norton AntiVirus remains in memory
with no way of terminating. The following examples demonstrate
correct usage to schedule automatic scans three times per week.

For Windows NT 4.0:

 at 17:30 /interactive /every:M,W,F "A:\Program Files\NAVNT\navwnt" /L

For Windows NT 3.51:

 at 17:30 /interactive /every:M,W,F "A:\win32app\NAVNT\navwnt" /L

See your Windows NT documentation for more information on using the AT
command.

LiveUpdate modem support for NT 3.51
-------------------------------------
LiveUpdate is the automatic virus definitions files update feature.
LiveUpdate requires TAPI support to run with a modem connection.
Because TAPI is only available under NT 4.0, LiveUpdate will not be 
able to use a modem under NT 3.51.

Installation from long-filename folders on NetWare servers
----------------------------------------------------------
On a Novell NetWare server, you cannot install Norton AntiVirus from
a long-filename folder.

Creating a test text file that looks like a virus
-------------------------------------------------
To create a harmless text file that will be detected as a virus,
which you can then use to verify detection of viruses, logging and
functioning of alerts, copy the following line in to a separate file,
saving it as trigger.com. This file is NOT a virus, but will be
detected as the "EICAR Test String.70" virus. Disable Auto-Protect
temporarily before you save the file.

X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

Using Netscape with Norton AntiVirus
------------------------------------
If Norton AntiVirus is installed as a Netscape helper application, a
a downloaded file will be lost if Netscape is closed before the 
download is complete.

Changing LiveUpdate automatic schedules
---------------------------------------
The first time that LiveUpdate completes a successful session, it 
offers to schedule future sessions automatically. If you want to 
modify or delete the scheduled sessions, access the Norton Program
Scheduler from the Norton AntiVirus group on the Start menu or the
Norton AntiVirus main window.

Uninstalling Norton NT Tools
----------------------------
If Norton NT Tools is uninstalled after Norton AntiVirus is installed,
the shared file S32STAT.DLL is removed. Reinstall Norton AntiVirus to 
correct the problem.

Preventing the Norton AntiVirus Startup Logo Screen from displaying
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Some users prefer not to see the startup logo screens that display 
when Norton AntiVirus components are loaded. They can be disabled
adding the following Registry entries:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Symantec\Norton AntiVirus\Auto-Protect]
"DisableSplashScreen"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Symantec\Norton AntiVirus NT\Clinic]
"DisableSplashScreen"=dword:00000001

Long Filenames and LiveUpdate 
-----------------------------
Long Filenames (LFNs) must be enabled on Windows NT systems to
install LiveUpdate.
