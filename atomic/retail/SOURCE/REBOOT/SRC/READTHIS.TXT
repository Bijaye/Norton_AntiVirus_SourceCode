This project produces REBOOT.EXE. If you are going to compile it, copy
all of the files on s: and n: to a local directory, and then open
the .MDP file through MSVC 4.2.

Also, after you copy them locally, rename these two files:

NAVWCOM1.H -> NAVWCOMM.H
NAVAPCO1.H -> NAVAPCOM.H

They could not be checked in under their usual names, since their names
conflicted with the other versions in the INCLUDE project.
