READ.ME for Norton AntiVirus Network Manager Version 3.0

Welcome to Norton AntiVirus Network Manager! This document contains
important information not included in the user documentation. 


Local Directory to Install To - Page 6
=========================================
The functionality of the Network Manager is different than the manual 
states for "Local Directory to Install To:".  These settings are 
located in the Install/Update category option. 

Use Previous Directory: Overwrites an existing version of Norton 
AntiVirus if found on the workstation. (This option assumes the Norton 
AntiVirus directory is in the workstation's PATH statement.)

If a previous version of Norton AntiVirus is not found, the user is 
either prompted for a location or Norton AntiVirus is installed into 
the directory specified in the Use Default text box (depending on 
which other option is selected.) 


Updating Configuration Settings
===============================
When a workstation logs onto the network, in addition to verifying that
the workstation is using the most recent version of Norton AntiVirus and
virus definitions files, the Network Manager also verifies that the most
recent configuration settings are being used. If the Norton AntiVirus
configuration settings on the workstation do not match those in the setup
file on the network, the workstation settings are updated, unless the
Retain Settings When Updating option is turned on.


Updating Virus Definitions in the NAVUPDAT Directory
====================================================
After installing a new set of virus definition files (VIRSCAN.DAT
and VIRSCAN.INF), you should scan the files with the copy of
NAV in your NAVUPDAT directory.  To do this, change to the directory
where the NAVUPDAT files are installed and type (including the period):

        NAV .

This will do the following:

1) Verify the integrity of the files in the NAVUPDAT directory.
   If a problem exists, detecting it now will avoid the same 
   errors at each workstation when NAVUPDAT runs.
2) Generate new INSCANM.DAT, INSCANB.DAT, and INSCANF.DAT files.
   If these files are not updated, NAVUPDAT will try to generate 
   them when it executes on the workstation.  If a workstation 
   does not have read/write/create/erase permission, the update will 
   fail.  Generating them now avoids this problem and allows NAVUPDAT
   to be run from a read-only directory.


Forcing Logoff and LAN Manager Networks
=======================================
"Force Logoff If Auto-Protect Not Installed" will not function properly 
on this network because LAN Manager restores the workstations' 
connections after the logon script executes.


NAVUPDAT Error Levels
=========================
The following DOS error levels can be returned when running the 
NAVUPDAT program.

   Error   Description
