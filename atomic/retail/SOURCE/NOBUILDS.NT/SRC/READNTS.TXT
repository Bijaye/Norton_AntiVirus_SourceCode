Print versions of Norton AntiVirus Guides
-----------------------------------------
Print versions of the Norton AntiVirus User and Implementation Guides
can be ordered through Symantec Customer Service.

Uninstall Beta versions of Norton AntiVirus
-------------------------------------------
If you tested a Beta version of Norton AntiVirus, uninstall the Beta
before installing the release version.  This removes unneeded files
that would otherwise remain on your disk and prevents problems that
could arise due to changed file formats.

Uninstalling LiveUpdate
-----------------------
Because LiveUpdate is shared among Symantec products, it is not
uninstalled automatically if you select Uninstall Norton AntiVirus.

To uninstall LiveUpdate, choose Add/Remove Programs from the Windows
Control Panel and select LiveUpdate.

Removing Norton AntiVirus from the Windows Start menu
-----------------------------------------------------
If Uninstall does not remove the Norton AntiVirus program group from
the Windows Start menu, you must remove it manually. To remove the
program group, right-click the taskbar, select Properties, click the
Start Menu Programs tab, click Remove, select Norton AntiVirus, and
then click Remove.

Options settings from earlier versions of Norton AntiVirus
----------------------------------------------------------
Options settings from versions 4.0 and earlier of Norton AntiVirus are
not preserved when you install Norton AntiVirus 5.0.

Scanning Removable Drives
-------------------------
Norton AntiVirus incorrectly identifies removable hard drives as fixed
drives. Removable drives (such as Zip drives) show up as local hard
drives even when the "all removable drives" checkbox is not checked.

Quarantining non-deletable files
--------------------------------
Norton AntiVirus cannot quarantine non-deletable files (for example,
files infected by the DirII virus). To manually add these types of
files to the Quarantine, open the Quarantine and choose Add Item.

Installing Norton AntiVirus and Microsoft Outlook 98
----------------------------------------------------
If Microsoft Outlook 98 is running during Norton AntiVirus
installation, the install will take a long time. Close Microsoft
Outlook 98 before installing Norton AntiVirus.

Novell NetWare: Installing from long filename (LFN) directories
---------------------------------------------------------------
Norton AntiVirus cannot be installed from long filename (LFN)
directories under Novell NetWare.

Installing Norton AntiVirus and Lotus Notes Server
--------------------------------------------------
You must first stop the Lotus Notes Server before installing Norton
AntiVirus. The setup program will not run while Lotus Notes Server
is running.

Access privileges required for installation
-------------------------------------------
As part of Norton AntiVirus installation, shared Symantec files, which
are components of all Symantec products, are always installed to
\Program Files\Symantec -- even if a custom location for the Norton
AntiVirus program files is specified during install. If you do not
have write (and create, if necessary) privileges to this location,
the install will fail.

Short File Name (SFN) alias generation during install
-----------------------------------------------------
If you are installing Norton AntiVirus to a custom location that is
a Long File Name (LFN) folder, SFN alias generation must not be
disabled during the install. To re-enable SFN alias generation, run
REGEDT32 and change the following registry key entry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem

  NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation should be set to 0 to enable SFN
  alias generation.

You must restart your NT machine in order for changes in SFN alias
generation to take effect. Set the value back to 1 after installation
to disable SFN alias generation, if desired.

Using the /INTERACTIVE switch with the AT command to schedule scans
-------------------------------------------------------------------
You must use the /INTERACTIVE switch to schedule scans with the AT
command. If NAVWNT is launched from the NT Scheduling Service (AT)
without the /INTERACTIVE switch, Norton AntiVirus remains in memory
with no way of terminating. The following examples demonstrate
correct usage to schedule automatic scans three times per week.

For Windows NT 4.0:

 at 17:30 /interactive /every:M,W,F "c:\Program Files\NAVNT\navwnt" /L

See your Windows NT documentation for more information on using the AT
command.

Installation from long-filename folders on NetWare servers
----------------------------------------------------------
On a Novell NetWare server, you cannot install Norton AntiVirus from
a long-filename folder.

Creating a test text file that looks like a virus
-------------------------------------------------
To create a harmless text file that will be detected as a virus,
which you can then use to verify detection of viruses, logging and
functioning of alerts, copy the following line in to a separate file,
saving it as trigger.com. This file is NOT a virus, but will be
detected as the "EICAR Test String.70" virus. Disable Auto-Protect
temporarily before you save the file.

X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

Using Netscape with Norton AntiVirus
------------------------------------
If Norton AntiVirus is installed as a Netscape helper application, a
a downloaded file will be lost if Netscape is closed before the
download is complete.

Changing LiveUpdate automatic schedules
---------------------------------------
The first time that LiveUpdate completes a successful session, it
offers to schedule future sessions automatically. If you want to
modify or delete the scheduled sessions, access the Norton Program
Scheduler from the Norton AntiVirus group on the Start menu or the
Norton AntiVirus main window.

Uninstalling Norton NT Tools
----------------------------
If Norton NT Tools is uninstalled after Norton AntiVirus is installed,
the shared file S32STAT.DLL is removed. Reinstall Norton AntiVirus to
correct the problem.

Preventing the Norton AntiVirus Startup Logo Screen from displaying
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Some users prefer not to see the startup logo screens that display
when Norton AntiVirus components are loaded. They can be disabled
adding the following Registry entries:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Symantec\Norton AntiVirus\Auto-Protect]
"DisableSplashScreen"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Symantec\Norton AntiVirus NT\Clinic]
"DisableSplashScreen"=dword:00000001

Quarantining Multi-stream Files
-------------------------------
The Norton AntiVirus Windows NT Scanner quarantines multi-stream files
(for example, Macintosh files) on an NTFS volume. On a FAT volume, the
Norton AntiVirus Windows NT Scanner will only quarantine the
multi-stream file's default stream.

Auto-Protect will only quarantine a multi-stream file's default stream
on both NTFS and non-NTFS volumes.

Long Filenames and LiveUpdate
-----------------------------
Long Filenames (LFNs) must be enabled on Windows NT systems to
install LiveUpdate.

Network application performance issues with AutoProtect running
---------------------------------------------------------------
AutoProtect by default, opens files on a network drive in shared mode.
This can increase the time it takes for an application to load over
the network. To speedup load time of applications, you can configure
Auto-Protect to open files in non-shared mode. To do this,
double-click the APNTFAST.REG file located in the Norton AntiVirus
folder, then restart your computer.

If sharing violations occur after setting AutoProtect to non-shared
mode, reset Auto-Protect to shared mode. To do this, double-click the
APNTNORM.REG file, then restart your computer.

Scanning Magneto-Optical (MO) drives larger than 640 MB
-------------------------------------------------------
Norton AntiVirus does not properly scan boot records on magneto-
optical (MO) drives larger than 640 MB.

To disable boot record scans of MO drives larger than 640 MB:

 * Start Norton AntiVirus, click Options, click the Scanner tab,
   and then uncheck Boot Records in the What To Scan group.

IRPStackSize
------------
When you install Norton Antivirus for NT, your registry setting for
IRPStacksize should not change.

If the setting does not already exist, our installer will create it with
a setting size of 6.  If the setting does exist, but is below 6, our
installer will increment it to 6.  If the setting does exist, but is 6
or higher, but below 11, our installer will increment it by 2.  If the
setting does exist, but is already at 11 or 12, our installer will not
touch it.

If you are having difficulties starting the NAV AP services, increment the
IRPStacksize by 2 and restart.

Please note that 12 is the maximum allowed by the operating system.

If you uninstall Norton Antivirus for NT and it is the last Symantec
product that uses symevent.sys, we will normally decrement that setting
by 2, down to a level of 6. We check a usage count first to determine
if we are the "last out."

This setting is required by the operating system and is related to I/O devices
and device filters. Not having this set high enough can negatively impact the
loading of the NAV Autoprotect. It can also negatively impact access to
devices such as CDRoms. It can also negatively impact applications that are
I/O intensive.

Internet access problems with LiveUpdate
----------------------------------------
LiveUpdate operation may be restricted because of firewalls or proxy
servers.  Contact your network administrator if you have problems
using LiveUpdate due to your network security policy.

Additional information for system administrators 
------------------------------------------------
If you're a system administrator and would like information about
Norton AntiVirus Administration Tools or other Corporate products,
please visit our website at:

    http://www.symantec.com/solutions/navcorp.html

Activity Log "Access Denied Errors" option
------------------------------------------
The Activity Log includes a new option to report attempts to scan when
access is denied.  For example, an administrator may try to scan a
folder to which you have prevented others from accessing by setting
access permissions.  Norton AntiVirus will report in the Activity Log
that an attempt was made to scan your restricted-access folder. 

Online manuals: "Cannot find or run file" error message
-------------------------------------------------------
You must install Adobe Acrobat Reader to view the Norton AntiVirus
online manuals. 

To install Adobe Acrobat Reader:

  1 On the Windows Taskbar, click Start, point to Programs, 
    point to Norton AntiVirus, and click Norton AntiVirus to open
    the Norton AntiVirus main window.

  2 From the Help menu, point to Product Support Online, and click 
    Product Support.

  3 In the Product Support help window that appears, click 
    Install Adobe Acrobat Reader.

Rename Error during Norton AntiVirus installation 
-------------------------------------------------
     
If you experience a Comctl32.dll rename error when installing 
Norton AntiVirus, an error dialog box on your screen shows 
the following information:
     
    RENAME ERROR
     
    An error occurred renaming a file "Cannot create a file when 
    that file already exists"(error #183).
     
    Current File Name: C:\WINNT\System32\Comctl32.dll 
    New File Name: C:\WINNT\System32\comctl32.bak
     
To fix the Comctl32.dll rename error:
     
1) From Windows Explorer, access the following directory:
     
      \winnt\system32
     
2) Right-click the following file:
     
      comctl32.bak
     
   Select Rename
     
3) Type the following as the new name for the file:
     
      comctl32.old
     
4) Run the Norton AntiVirus install program (setup.exe) again.
