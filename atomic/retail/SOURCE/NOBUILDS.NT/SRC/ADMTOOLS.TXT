Three components are installed for Windows 95/98 and Windows NT in
the NAVNET32 folder:

 * NAVUP: Network Manager for Windows 95/NT for Norton AntiVirus
   distributions that occur as part of the login process.

 * LUAdmin: LiveUpdate Administrator to establish an internal site
   for LiveUpdate sessions.

 * BkOffice: Back Office packet distribution files (PDFs) for
   networks managed by Microsoft SMS.

Please see the administrator's guide for directions to use these
components.

Notes:

* Be sure to install the Network Manager Configuration Program
  which you can use with Network Manager for Windows 95/98 and
  NT to configure Windows 95/98 and Windows NT installs. To
  install, run the setup program located on your Norton
  AntiVirus CD-ROM in \NAVNETW.

* If you don’t require that distributions occur as part of the
  login process, consider using Norton System Center. Norton
  System Center can distribute to multiple servers and
  workstations in your environment. It allows you to quickly
  change your environment and receive status of installation
  in real time.

* With products on this CD, you can centralize alerting and the
  quarantine of virus-infected files. For the centralized alert
  server, use Norton System Center or Norton AntiVirus for Windows
  NT Server. For centralized quarantine, use Norton AntiVirus for
  Windows NT Server's Quarantine Service. Please see the
  administrator's guide for more information.
