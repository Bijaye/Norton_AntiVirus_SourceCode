Each of the Roswell/Tesla CD-ROMs has a different AutoRun, which is 
done by changing the CDSTART.HLP file. Depending upon the CD, the 
CDSTART.HLP file comes from a different project and makefile:

Roswell Basic CD          <-- ROSWELL CDSTRHLP autoros.hlp
Roswell Deluxe CD         <-- ROSWELL CDSTRHLP autorosd.hlp
Tesla CD                  <-- ROSWELL CDSTRHLP autotesl.hlp
Roswell Basic 10-Pack CD  <-- ROSWELL CDSTR10P autor10p.hlp
Roswell Deluxe 10-Pack CD <-- ROSWELL CDSTR10P autod10p.hlp

The source code in the CDSTRHLP project is the code that should 
be carried forward.

The source code in the CDSTR10P project was branched from the 
CDSTRHLP project as a quick hack to avoid having to tamper with the
CDSTRHLP project during STM. The CDSTART.HLP for the 10-packs does
nothing new except for include a few new links to the network admin
programs and docs.
