This text file describes how to use the CMigrant class to assist in the
implementation of a Windows 9x to Windows NT5.0 migration DLL.  The CMigrant
class allows you to derive your own class to implement specialized tasks your
application may need during such a migration.  CMigrant is created and called
from the "migrate.cpp" module.


STEPS TO USING "CMigrant"

*) Derive your class from CMigrant (Migrant.h) and implement the following
   virtual functions:
   -- CheckAppInstallation(void) = 0;
   -- CopyAppFiles(void);
   -- InitAppDirs(void) = 0;
   -- InitAppID(void) = 0;
   -- IsAppInstalled(void) = 0;
   -- WriteMigrationFlag(void) = 0;
   Note that all are pure functions except "CopyAppFiles" (although you'll
   most likely want to implement this function as well).

*) Modify "CreateMig.cpp" so it will create an instance of your derived class.
   (Remember to include the header for your derived class.)

*) Initialize the static class members of the CMigrant class (a convenient
   place to do this in the module that contains the implementation of your
   derived class):
   -- CMigrant::m_szInstallDirFiles[]
   -- CMigrant::m_szProgramFilesSymantecFiles[]
   -- CMigrant::m_szCommonFilesSymantecFiles[]
   -- CMigrant::m_szMigInfExeFiles[]
   -- CMigrant::m_szSymantecSharedRegkeys[]
   -- CMigrant::m_codePageArray[]

*) Include your derived class files and any other files you need in the
   project, and "migrate.cpp" should drive everything for you!


Some additional sources for information are:

*) Go to the MIGRATE project in the Roswell area (env Roswell, proj Migrate)
   for a working example of how this stuff works.  You should be able to
   replace the "NavMig95.cpp" and header with your own implementation.

*) There are several documents describing the Roswell effort in the "Migration
   DLL" folder on ussm-admin1\shared\shared.

*) The Microsoft document "MigExt.doc" has detailed information on exactly
   what the migration DLL is supposed to do, and how to do it (also on
   ussm-admin1\shared\shared).

*) Some official web sites for migration information are:
   -- http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/guidelns/95vsnt.htm has a lengthy
      article that discusses some platform differences between Win95 and NT
   -- http://www.microsoft.com/WIN32DEV/GUIDELNS/TESTNT40.HTM discusses tips
      for what to test to see if your Win95 app runs on NT correctly
   -- http://www.microsoft.com/windows/thirdparty/winlogo/enterprise/
      roadmap2.htm has the latest draft of logo requirements
   -- the "Docs" directory has several MS docs from the workshop (the
      documents "migext.doc" is especially full of technical details); there
      is also a PowerPoint subdirectory containing slides from their
      presentations
