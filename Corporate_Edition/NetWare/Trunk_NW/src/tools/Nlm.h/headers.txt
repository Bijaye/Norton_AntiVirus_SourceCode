Intel has altered some of the Watcom header files.
The altered versions are kept in Perforce for building.
At this time, the only project using these header files 
is RTVSCAN.NLM. I have changed the include paths in 
bldbeluga.bat and the make file to check this directory 
first. These header files need to be synced to the 
local system when building Beluga.
