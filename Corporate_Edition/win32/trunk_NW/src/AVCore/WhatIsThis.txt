    Removing the dependencies of the SavCorp and QServer build environments on 
	Core and AVCore build environments. Created this area for include files
	(from both Core and AVCore), Nobuilds, and selected components that are
	now built as part of SavCorp. Core / AVCore code areas are no longer 
	used, and all references to T: and L: have been removed.

    See the summary document //depot/crt/docs/SavCorp/8.01 - NoAVCore.doc
