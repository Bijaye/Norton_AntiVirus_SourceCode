Each of the projects in Ansel (win32) use the following settings:

Compiler warning level 3 for release and debug (/W3)
Create "Program Database" output for release (/Zi)
Generate a mapfile for both release and debug (/map /mapinfo:exports /mapinfo:lines)
Linker for release builds generates debug output (/debug /opt:ref)

Each DLL is (re)based (/base:"0xHHH00000")

These base values are set in each DLLs DSP file:

exchext.dll	0x61000000
notesext.dll	0x64000000
ncschdlr.dll	0x64100000
sesahook.dll	0x66000000
