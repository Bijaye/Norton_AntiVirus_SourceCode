CREATING A RESCUE DISK
=================================================================

After you install Symantec AntiVirus(TM) Corporate Edition, we 
recommend that you create a rescue disk to recover your computer
if its system files are ever corrupted by a boot sector virus.
The process of creating a rescue disk is quick and easy for
Windows* 95/98 computers. For Windows NT* 4.0 and 
Windows 3.1x computers, the process takes a little more time.

--------------------------------
Why do I need a rescue disk?
--------------------------------

Most boot sector viruses can damage a computer by destroying or 
altering the master boot record, file allocation table, or other
fundamental information on the hard disk, making it unusable.

If a boot sector virus infects and damages a computer, Symantec
AntiVirus provides a way for you to restore the original boot 
sector and get the computer back into operation.

To repair a computer damaged by a boot sector virus, you must make
a rescue disk and a bootable system disk before the computer is 
infected. Without a rescue disk, an infected computer could be
unrecoverable.

The rescue disk contains:
*  A copy of the computer's boot sector and partition tables.
*  The DOS version of Symantec AntiVirus, VSCAND.
*  The pattern files that VSCAND uses.

The bootable system disk contains:
*  COMMAND.COM
*  Other hidden files that make it possible to boot your damaged 
   computer from a floppy disk while bypassing the hard disk.

--------------------------------
How many rescue disks do I need?
--------------------------------
You need to create a separate rescue disk for each of your 
computers. Symantec AntiVirus copies the computer's boot sector and 
partition tables on the rescue disk. This information is 
computer-specific. If you have more than one computer, 
we recommend that you label each rescue disk with a name
that identifies the computer it belongs to.

--------------------------------
How many system disks do I need?
--------------------------------
You need only one system disk, even if you have several computers. 
 
=================================================================
CREATING A RESCUE DISK FOR WINDOWS 95/98 COMPUTERS
=================================================================

Symantec AntiVirus automates the process of creating a rescue
disk for Windows 95/98 computers. Symantec AntiVirus creates
a rescue disk that contains the necessary files for restoring a
computer's boot sector and also creates a system boot disk
containing files needed to boot your computer from a floppy.
You will need two formatted, blank 1.44 MB floppy disks. 

     1  Click Configure | Create Rescue Disk.
     2  Insert a formatted, blank 1.44 MB floppy disk in the 
        computer's floppy drive.
     3  Select the letter of the computer's bootable hard drive
        (usually drive C).
     4  Select the letter of the computer's floppy drive.
     5  (Optional) If you want to create a system boot disk,
        check the "Also create system boot disk" option. 
     6  Click Create.

        Symantec AntiVirus will copy the rescue disk files to your
        floppy disk.

=================================================================
CREATING A RESCUE DISK FOR CONNECTED COMPUTERS
=================================================================

These instructions describe how to make a rescue disk for a
computer connected to a Symantec AntiVirus Server. If your computer
is not connected to a protected server, view the instructions
for creating a rescue disk for a standalone computer.

The instructions for creating a rescue disk are different for 
Windows 95/98 and all other computers. If you installed 
Symantec AntiVirus on a computer running Windows 95/98,
then you can create a rescue disk during installation, or later
using the utilities available in Symantec AntiVirus. If you have a
computer running Windows NT or Windows 3.1, the following instructions 
walk you through a series of steps to help you create
the rescue disks.

You need a blank, formatted high density (1.44 MB) floppy 
disk. A low density disk does not have enough disk space. 
Repeat these steps for each computer you want to protect.

----------------------------------
Connected Windows NT 4.0 computers
----------------------------------

You will need 1 blank, formatted high density 1.44 MB floppy
disk and a bootable system disk.

Step A:  Copy RESCUE files to a floppy disk

     1 Your system administrator should grant access to a RESCUE
       folder on the network. (Your system administrator can find
       instructions on how to create this folder in the 
       administrator online help under "Creating a rescue folder.")
     2 In Windows NT Explorer, locate the RESCUE folder.
     3 Copy the files from the RESCUE folder to a blank formatted
       floppy disk.
     4 Close Windows NT Explorer.

Step B:  Copy the boot sector using the VSCAND /RESCUE option

     1 Turn off the computer, then insert a bootable system disk
       into the floppy drive and boot the computer.
     2 Remove the system disk, then insert the floppy disk with
       the RESCUE files in your floppy disk drive.
     3 Click Start | Run, then enter:
       A:\VSCAND /RESCUE
       where A: represents the letter of your floppy disk drive.
     4 Enter the letter of the source hard disk (usually "C:").
     5 Enter the drive letter where you want to store the boot sector
       information. This is the letter of the
       floppy disk drive, (usually A:). 
       NOTE: After you've entered source and destination 
       drives, Symantec AntiVirus copies the boot sector information
       (in a file called BOOTPART.C) to the rescue disk.
       DO NOT PERMANENTLY STORE THIS FILE ON THE HARD DISK AS YOUR
       ONLY SOURCE OF BACKUP, because if your computer should
       become infected by a boot virus, you would not be able to
       access this information. 
     6 Label the floppy disk SYMANTEC ANTIVIRUS RESCUE DISK, then 
       write the computer name on the label. Store the disk
       in a safe place for emergency use.
 
----------------------------------------------------
Connected Windows 3.1x computers
----------------------------------------------------
You will need 1-3 blank, formatted high density 1.44 MB floppy
disks.

Step A:  Copy RESCUE files to a floppy disk
  
     1 Your system administrator should give you access
       to a RESCUE folder on the network. (Your system administrator
       can find instructions on how to create this folder in the 
       administrator online help under "Creating a rescue folder.")
     2 In File Manager, locate the RESCUE folder.
     3 Copy the files from the RESCUE folder to a blank, formatted 
       floppy disk.
     4 Close Windows, then close File Manager.

Step B:  Copy the boot sector using the VSCAND /RESCUE option

     1 Insert the floppy disk with the RESCUE files in your
       floppy disk drive.
     2 From Program Manager, click File | Run, then enter:
       A:\VSCAND /RESCUE
       where A: represents the letter of your floppy 
       disk drive.
     3 Enter the letter of the source hard disk (usually C:).
     4 Enter the drive letter where you want to store the boot sector
       information. This is the letter of the
       floppy disk drive, (usually A:). 
       NOTE: After you've entered source and destination 
       drives, Symantec AntiVirus copies the boot sector information
       (in a file called BOOTPART.C) to the rescue disk.
       DO NOT PERMANENTLY STORE THIS FILE ON THE HARD DISK AS YOUR
       ONLY SOURCE OF BACKUP, because if your computer should
       become infected by a boot virus, you would not be able to
       access this information. 
     5 Label the floppy disk SYMANTEC ANTIVIRUS RESCUE DISK,
       then write the computer name on the label. Store the
       disk in a safe place for emergency use.

=================================================================
CREATING A RESCUE DISK FOR STANDALONE COMPUTERS
=================================================================

The following instructions describe how to make a rescue disk
for a standalone computer, such as a laptop not connected to
a network, or a home computer. 

The instructions for creating a rescue disk are different for
Windows 3.1x, Windows 95/98, and Windows NT. If you
installed Symantec AntiVirus on a computer running Windows 95/98,
then you can create a rescue disk during installation, or later
using the utilities available in Symantec AntiVirus. If you have a
computer running Windows NT or Windows 3.1x, this document will
walk you through a series of steps to help you create the rescue
disks. 

The instructions assume a copy of Symantec AntiVirus is installed
on your computer, and that the Symantec AntiVirus CD is available. 
Also, you will need a blank, formatted high density (1.44 MB) 
floppy disk. A low density disk does not have enough disk space.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Standalone Windows NT 4.0 computers and Windows 3.1x computers
-------------------------------------------------------------

Step A:  Create a RESCUE folder

     In Windows Explorer, create a temporary folder on your
     hard disk, named RESCUE (the folder should be empty):
     C:\RESCUE

Step B:  Copy files from Symantec AntiVirus CD

     Using Windows Explorer, copy these files from
     the \DOS folder on the Symantec AntiVirus CD to the RESCUE
     folder:
     * ENUVSCAN.DAT 
     * VSCAND.EXE  (DOS scanner file)
     * RESCUE.TXT (rescue disk documentation)
     * RESCUE.BAT
 
Step C:  Copy files from WILD folder

     1 Using Windows Explorer, locate the WILD folder in the 
       directory where your Symantec AntiVirus program files are
       installed. By default, the WILD folder is found here:

(Windows NT) C:\PROGRAM FILES\NAV\I2_ldvp.vdb\{recent pattern file}\WILD.
(Windows 3.x) Locate a Windows 95/98 or Windows NT 4.0 machine and
 copy the files from the WILD folder.
       
       HINT: An example of a pattern file name is VD031C01.VDB.
       Pattern files always begin with the letters "VD" followed
       by a sequence of letters and numbers. If there's more 
       than one pattern file folder, compare the dates the 
       folders were created to determine which one is most recent. 
     2 Copy the files in the WILD folder to the RESCUE 
       folder. These files include:
       * NAVEX15.EXP
       * VSCAND1.DAT
       * VSCAND2.DAT
       * VSCAND3.DAT
       * VSCAND4.DAT
     3 Close Windows Explorer.

Step D:  Copy files from RESCUE folder to disk 

     1 Open Windows Explorer.
     2 Copy these files in the WILD folder to the blank
       formatted floppy disk in your floppy disk drive:
       * ENUVSCAN.DAT 
       * VSCAND.EXE  (DOS scanner file)
       * RESCUE.BAT  (RESCUE program)
       * RESCUE.TXT  (RESCUE disk documentation)
       * NAVEX15.EXP
       * VSCAND1.DAT
       * VSCAND2.DAT
       * VSCAND3.DAT
       * VSCAND4.DAT
     3 Close Windows Explorer.

Step E:  Copy the computer's boot sector to the floppy disk 
     1 (Windows NT computers) Turn off the computer, then 
       insert a bootable system disk into the floppy drive and
       boot the computer. Remove the system disk, then insert
       the floppy disk with the RESCUE files in your floppy 
       disk drive.
       (Windows 3.1x computers)Insert the floppy disk with
       the RESCUE files in your floppy disk drive.
     2 Click Start | Run, then enter:
       A:\VSCAND /RESCUE
       where A: represents the letter of your floppy disk drive.
     3 Enter the letter of the source hard disk (usually C:).
     4 Enter the drive letter where you want to store the backup
       information. This is the letter of the
       floppy disk drive, (usually A:). 
       NOTE: After you have entered source and destination 
       drives, Symantec AntiVirus copies the boot sector information
       (in a file called BOOTPART.C) to the rescue disk.
     5 Label the floppy disk SYMANTEC ANTIVIRUS RESCUE DISK,
       then write the computer name on the label. Store the
       disk in a safe place for emergency use.
 
=================================================================
TO CREATE A BOOTABLE SYSTEM DISK
=================================================================
Note that you cannot create a system disk on a Windows NT 4.0
computer. Create a system disk on a Windows 95 or a Windows 
3.1x computer.

     1  Insert a blank, formatted disk into a computer.
     2  At the command prompt, enter this command:
	  SYS A:
        where A: is the letter of the floppy drive. This creates
        a bootable system disk.
     3  Scan the floppy disk to verify that it is virus-free, then 
        write-protect it.
     4  Label the disk SYSTEM DISK.

=================================================================
USING THE RESCUE DISK TO RECOVER AN INFECTED COMPUTER
=================================================================

If you suspect your computer has been damaged by a boot
sector virus (because you are unable to boot your computer), 
you can use the rescue disk to clean the virus or restore
your computer's boot sector.

------------------
Cleaning the virus
------------------

You should first attempt to scan and clean the boot sector
virus from the computer. Cleaning removes the virus from
the computer's boot sector and partition tables. 

To clean an infected boot sector, use the system disk
to boot the computer, then use the rescue disk you created
to run the Symantec AntiVirus scanner, VSCAND, on the infected
drive.

VSCAND detects the virus on your computer and if the virus is
cleanable, will prompt you to clean the computer.

------------------------------------
Restoring the computer's boot sector
------------------------------------

Some boot viruses cannot be cleaned. If this is the case,
you can still attempt to restore the computer using the rescue
disk. The rescue disk replaces the infected boot sector with
a clean, uninfected boot sector stored on the rescue disk.

This process destroys the virus and prevents it from 
spreading.

------------------------------------------
Removing write-protection before you begin
------------------------------------------

If your rescue disk is write-protected, move the button
at the corner of the floppy disk to ensure it is 
write-enabled. Once the disk is write-enabled, 
Symantec AntiVirus can copy, save, and edit files
on the floppy disk. Symantec AntiVirus 
writes a log file to the rescue disk during disk recovery.

-----------------------
To clean a boot virus
-----------------------

     You will need a bootable system disk, the rescue disk, and
     a blank, formatted floppy disk.

     1  Turn off the computer for 15 seconds, then insert
        the system disk in the floppy disk drive.
     2  Restart the computer.
     3  After the computer has booted, this prompt displays:
        A:\>
     4  Remove the system disk from the floppy drive, then
        insert the rescue disk.
     5  Enter this command at the prompt:
        VSCAND C: /P
        where /P represents the partition, and C: is the
        drive you want to clean. VSCAND will scan the boot 
        partition for any boot sector viruses.
     6  A message prompts you to clean the virus or leave
        it alone. At the prompt, type:
        C
     7  If the boot sector was successfully cleaned, remove
        the rescue disk, then restart the computer WITHOUT
        the system disk.
        If the computer still does not boot, or if the boot
        virus was not successfully cleaned, follow the 
        instructions in "To Restore an Infected Computer".
      
-----------------------------------------------
To restore an infected computer (all platforms)
-----------------------------------------------
    
     1 Turn off the computer for 15 seconds, then insert the 
       system disk and restart the computer.
     2 After the computer has booted and you are at the A: prompt,
       remove the system disk.
     3 Insert the rescue disk, then enter: RESCUE
     4 Follow the prompts.
     
     The Symantec AntiVirus VSCAND program will copy the uninfected 
     boot sector and partition table from the rescue disk to the
     computer. This process overwrites the virus and makes the
     virus unable to spread.
