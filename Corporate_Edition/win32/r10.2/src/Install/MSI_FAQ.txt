This file is a list of the most commonly used MSI commands for Symantec 
AntiVirus and Symantec Client Security. For a complete list of commands, 
properties, and features, see the Symantec Knowledge Base.


BASIC MSI commands
------------------
/QN - Quiet No UI
/QB - Quiet Basic UI
/L*V log.txt - full verbose logging to file log.txt

MSI logging
------------------
When run from the setup.exe stub Symantec AntiVirus, Symantec Client Security, and Symantec System Center automatically create installer logs to the %TEMP% folder (e.g. C:\Documents and Settings\<USERNAME>\Local Settings\Temp) named either SAV_INST.LOG, SCS_INST.LOG, or SSC_INST.LOG respectively. 
When the installers are run from either the ClientRemote or AVServer tools the installer logs are automatically created in the %WINDIR%\temp folder (e.g. C:\WINDOWS\temp) named VPREMOTE.LOG.
These installer logs are vital in determining installer failures. Please have these logs available when contacting Symantec Support.
* Note – Localized operating systems may have slightly different folders for the log files. You can resolve this by clicking on the start button, clicking run and then entering either %TEMP% for the temp folder or %WINDIR%\temp for the windows temp folder.
Please see the “Reading Installer logs” section below for more information.

BASIC MSI properties
--------------------
REBOOT=REALLYSUPPRESS – During migration a reboot may be required. By suppressing a required reboot, full product functionality may not be available until a reboot has taken place. This may not be apparent on a silent install or migration as no User Interface messages are displayed.

SAV & SCS properties
--------------
INSTALLSERVER= (1 = Server, 0 = Client, Default is 0 = Client).  
When installing a server:
	SERVERGROUPNAME= (New or preexisting servergroup)
	SERVERGROUPUSERNAME= (New or preexisting servergroup user name, The
                              default is admin)
	SERVERGROUPPASS= (New or preexisting servergroup password. The default 
                          is symantec)
	SERVERPARENT= (e.g. SERVERPARENT=MySavServer)
	Note: For a silent install of a secondary server from the command line, 
	you must set the SERVERPARENT property to the parent server computer
	name. When performing a server rollout from the UI or Symantec System Center rollout install, 
	setting this property is not required as the tool automatically fills this in.

NETWORKTYPE= (1 = Managed, 2 = Unmanaged, Default is 2 = Unmanaged)
When installing a managed client:
	SERVERNAME= (preexisting SAV Server)
	Note: The SERVERNAME must be a name.  It cannot be an IP address.

RUNLIVEUPDATE= (1 = run LiveUpdate after install, 0 = do not run LiveUpdate after install, 
                default = 1 run LiveUpdate after install)

ENABLEAUTOPROTECT= (1 = ON, 0 = OFF, Default is 1 = ON)

SYMPROTECTDISABLED= (0 = ON, 1 = OFF, Default is 0 = ON)

DISABLEDEFENDER= (1 = Disable Windows Defender, 0 = Do not disable Windows Defender, Default is 1 = Disable Windows Defender)

INSTALLDIR= (Install target directory, default is C:\Program Files\
             Symantec AntiVirus)

SAV10UNINSTALLFIXRUN= (1 = already run, 0 = not yet run)
Upgrading SAV10.x or SCS3.x requires modification of the cached install package
or the upgrade will fail.  If SAV10.x or SCS3.x are detected, the install will
abort unless the user is an administrator of the local machine.  Setting
this property to 1 disables this check.  Note that enabling MSI to run with
elevated privileges is not sufficient in this case.  In addition to
installing as a local administrator, the modification can be accomplished in
two other ways:
1.  Temporarily grant users write access to the Windows\Installer directory
for the duration of the upgrade.
2.  Run the tool Tools\Sav9UninstallFix under the credentials of an account
with write access to Windows\Installer, and then execute the upgrade with the
property SAV9UNINSTALLFIXRUN=1 on the command line.


Windows Security Center features
--------------------------------
These properties allow for the configuration of the interaction
between users and the Windows Security Center (WSC) running on Windows® XP
Service Pack 2.

These properties apply to unmanaged clients only. The Symantec System Center
controls these properties for managed clients.

WSCCONTROL= (0= No action, 1 = Disable once, 2 = Disable always, 3 = Restore if disabled)
Allows an administrator of a non-managed network to configure the WindowsSecurityCenterControl
value set on the SSC Client Administrator Only General tab.

WSCAVALERT= (0= Disable, 1 = Enable, Default is 0 = Disable)
Allows an administrator of a non-managed network to configure the AntiVirusDisableNotify value for Windows Security Center.

WSCFWALERT= (0= Disable, 1 = Enable, Default is 0 = Disable)
Allows an administrator of a non-managed network to configure the FireWallDisableNotify value for Windows Security Center.

WSCAVUPTODATE= (Integer value between 1 and 90, Default is 30)
Allows an administrator of a non-managed network to configure the number of days used to determine if threat definitions are up to date for Windows Security Center.
 

SCS-only properties
-------------------
ICFCONTROL= (0= No action, 1 = Disable once, 2 = Disable always, 3 = Restore if disabled)

ICFDISABLENOTIFY= (0= Do not disable the notification message, 1= Disable the notification message)


SAV features
------------
SAVUI - AntiVirus User Interface
SAVHelp - AntiVirus Help
QClient - Quarantine Client
EMailTools - AntiVirus Email Tools Parent Feature
NotesSnapin - Lotus Notes Email Snapin
OutlookSnapin - MS Outlook Email Snapin
Pop3Smtp - Internet POP3 Email Snapin
Note - The EmailTools features are not installed on a SAV or SCS Server install.

SCS features
------------
SCFHelp - Firewall Help
AntiSpam – AdBlocking


Adding and removing features
----------------------------
To remove existing features:

REMOVE=<feature1>,<feature2>,<feature3>

To add new features:

ADDLOCAL=<feature1>,<feature2>,<feature3>, <existing feature 1>, 
         <existing feature 2>, etc.

Note: When adding new features using ADDLOCAL, any existing features on the 
target computer that you want to retain must be included or the installation will remove any features on the target computer that are not listed.

DEPLOYING TO VISTA CLIENTS
--------------------
The Symantec Deployment tools (ClientRemote and AVServer) require the remote target client computer to be running the Remote Registry service. In versions of Windows prior to Vista this service was on by default however in Microsoft Vista it is now off by default. ClientRemote has the ability to remotely detect that Remote Registry service is not running and start it. If ClientRemote does start the service, it will also disable the service once it has completed running. If it does not start it then it will not stop the service. Depending on the speed of the target client computer and various other timing issues, ClientRemote may prompt that the target client computers do not have the Remote Registry service running and if this happens you are advised to re-add the client a second time as this often works.

Using administrative accounts and ClientRemote to deploy SAV clients to Microsoft Vista Clients. When Microsoft Vista is configured with UAC (User Account Control) turned on, local Administrative accounts (Little Abby) are filtered and are not able to remotely access remote administrative shares (C$, Admin$) as they were in previous versions of Windows. To use ClientRemote in this scenario either use a Domain Administrative account (Big Abby) if the client computer is on an Active Directory domain. Otherwise you must disable the client computer's local account filtering policy by creating the following registry key on the target machine. 
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\system\ LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy 
DWORD: 1

MULTIPLE CLIENT SUPPORT ON SAVSERVER
--------------------
The 10.2 release of SAV Server and ClientRemote now features the ability to stage and automatically deploy all of the SAV Client installers to multiple client operating systems during one rollout. Previous versions of SAV Server would only stage one client either SAV or SCS. The SAV 10.2 release CD now contains several new folders;
SAV
SAVVISTA
SAVWin64
SAVWin64VISTA

This new feature allows ClientRemote to automatically detect the remote client operating system, match up the correct SAV version, and seamlessly deploy different managed SAV installers to different client machines.
Previous SAV Servers would have the following Client Install folders;
C:\Program Files\SAV\CLT-INST\...
WIN32
WEBINST
In version 10.2 the SAV Server will now have the following Client Install folders;
C:\Program Files\SAV\CLT-INST\...
WIN32
(WIN32SCS – optionally)
WIN32VISTA
WIN64
WIN64VISTA
WEBINST

* Note – This multiple client deployment functionality is likely to change in future releases so please contact Symantec Support for the latest support information.


Reading Installer logs
--------------------
The common installer logs are SAV_INST.LOG, SCS_INST.LOG, or SSC_INST.LOG. These are standard MSI log files. You can search for an installer failure point by doing a text search for the string “value 3” (CTRL+F = find in Notepad). This is important in determining installer and migration failures, especially in silent scenarios. 
A small sample of common errors and messages are “This version of [ProductName] requires Internet Explorer 5.5 Service Pack 2.” or “This version of [ProductName] does not support 64-bit platforms.  Please install Symantec AntiVirus for Win64 instead.”
Please have the installer log file and error message available when contacting Symantec Support.

Command line example
--------------------
This example demonstrates a silent Symantec AntiVirus Server installation. 
The server is named MYSAVSERVER, has the user admin and uses the password 
MYSAVPASSWORD. LiveUpdate is not run, and the server is not restarted even 
if it is required.

Sample command line: 
setup /s /v"/l*v log.txt /qn INSTALLSERVER=1 SERVERGROUPNAME=MYSAVSERVER 
SERVERGROUPUSERNAME=admin SERVERGROUPPASS=MYSAVPASSWORD RUNLIVEUPDATE=0 
REBOOT=REALLYSUPPRESS"
