

International Program License Agreement (IPLA)
_______________________________________

 Part 1 - General Terms
 ______________________

  PLEASE  READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE
  USING THE PROGRAM.   IBM WILL  ONLY  LICENSE
  THE  PROGRAM  TO YOU IF YOU FIRST ACCEPT THE
  TERMS  OF  THIS  AGREEMENT  BY   USING   THE
  PROGRAM.    IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS
  OF THIS AGREEMENT, PROMPTLY NOTIFY THE  PRO-
  VIDER OF THE PROGRAM AND REQUEST A REFUND OF
  THE AMOUNT YOU PAID.


  The  Program is owned by International Busi-
  ness Machines Corporation or one of its sub-
  sidiaries (IBM) or an IBM supplier,  and  is
  copyrighted and licensed, not sold.

  IBM  grants  you  a nonexclusive license for
  the Program.   If IBM  grants  you  multiple
  licenses  for the Program, the terms of this
  Agreement apply to each license.   The  term
  "Program" means the original program and all
  whole  or  partial  copies  of it, including
  portions merged  into  other  programs.    A
  Program    consists    of   machine-readable
  instructions, audio/visual content (such  as
  images,  text, recordings, or pictures), and
  related licensed materials.  THIS  AGREEMENT
  INCLUDES PART 1 - GENERAL TERMS AND PART 2 -
  COUNTRY  UNIQUE TERMS.   THE TERMS OF PART 2
  MAY REPLACE  OR  MODIFY  THOSE  OF  PART  1.
  "LICENSE  INFORMATION,"  WHICH  IBM PROVIDES
  FOR  THE  PROGRAM,  MAY  CONTAIN  ADDITIONAL
  TERMS REGARDING THE PROGRAM.  ANY SUCH ADDI-
  TIONAL TERMS ARE PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  1.License
  _________

  USE OF THE PROGRAM

  You  may use the Program on only one machine
  at any one time, except as otherwise  stated
  in  this section.   You agree to ensure that
  anyone who uses the Program (accessed either
  locally or remotely) does so only  for  your
  authorized  use  and complies with the terms
  of this Agreement.

  A Program is considered to be in use when it
  resides in memory or is otherwise stored  on
  a  machine.    A Program stored on a network
  server solely for the purpose of being  dis-
  tributed to other machines is not considered
  to be in use.

  IBM  specifies charges for Programs based on
  how much you use a Program (for example, the
  number of users),  resources  (for  example,
  processor size), or a combination of both.

  For  a  Program managed by a license manage-
  ment tool, copies may be made and stored  on
  machines  under  control  of  that tool, but
  your use may not exceed the total number  of
  users or amount of resource authorized.

  Certain  Programs IBM designates for home or
  travel use may be stored on the primary  and
  another machine, provided the Program is not
  in  active  use on both machines at the same
  time.

  You may 1) copy the Program for  backup  and
  2)  merge  the Program into another program.
  You must reproduce the copyright notice  and
  any  other legend of ownership on each copy,
  or partial copy, of the Program.    You  may
  use  any  portion  of  the Program IBM marks
  restricted (for example,  "Restricted  Mate-
  rials  of  IBM") only to 1) resolve problems
  related to the use of  the  Program  and  2)
  modify  the  Program  so  that  it will work
  together with other products.

  You may  not:    1)  use,  copy,  merge,  or
  transfer  the  Program except as provided in
  this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse
  compile, or otherwise translate the  Program
  except  as  specifically  permitted  by  law
  without  the  possibility   of   contractual
  waiver;  or 3) sublicense, rent or lease the
  Program.

  TRANSFER OF RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

  You may transfer all your rights  and  obli-
  gations  under  a  license  for a Program to
  another party, unless IBM  specifies  other-
  wise in its License Information.

  To transfer such rights and obligations, you
  must  transfer a copy of this Agreement, the
  License Information, all other documentation
  (including proof  of  entitlement),  and  at
  least  one  complete,  unaltered copy of the
  Program to the other party.  Your license is
  then terminated.

  A Program which IBM licenses in multiples of
  two or more (for example,  as  a  pack)  may
  only  be  transferred  in its entirety.   In
  this case, individual licenses  may  not  be
  transferred.

  2. CHARGES, PAYMENT, AND TAXES
  ______________________________

  Payment  must  be  made to the party (either
  IBM or its reseller) from whom you  acquired
  the  Program.    If you acquired the Program
  from IBM, you agree to pay as IBM specifies.
  If any authority imposes a duty,  tax,  levy
  or  fee  (excluding those based on IBM's net
  income) on the Program supplied by IBM under
  this Agreement, you agree to pay that amount
  as  IBM  specifies  or  supply   appropriate
  exemption documentation.

  You  agree to notify IBM or its reseller and
  pay any applicable charges if you change the
  number  of  users  or  amount  of   resource
  authorized.    IBM  does not give refunds or
  credits for charges already due or paid.

  3. LIMITED WARRANTY
  ___________________

  For certain Programs IBM warrants that  when
  they  are  used  in  the specified operating
  environment they will conform to their spec-
  ifications.  IBM does not  warrant  uninter-
  rupted or error-free operation of a Program.
  The  warranty  period  for a Program expires
  when its  Program  services  are  no  longer
  available.   IBM will specify in its License
  Information if a Program is warranted or not
  warranted.

  During the warranty period warranty  service
  is provided, without charge, through defect-
  related  Program services.  Program services
  are available for at  least  one  year  fol-
  lowing  a  Program's  general  availability.
  Therefore, the duration of warranty  service
  depends on when you obtain your license.  If
  a  Program  does  not  function as warranted
  during the first year after you obtain  your
  license  and IBM is unable to make it do so,
  you may return  the  Program  to  the  party
  (either  IBM  or its reseller) from whom you
  acquired it and your money will be refunded.
  To be eligible, you must have  acquired  the
  Program  while  Program services (regardless
  of the remaining  duration)  were  available
  for it.

  THESE  WARRANTIES  REPLACE ALL OTHER WARRAN-
  TIES  OR  CONDITIONS,  EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED,
  INCLUDING,  BUT  NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF  MERCHANTABILITY
  AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  These  warranties  give  you  specific legal
  rights, and you may also have  other  rights
  which  vary  from  jurisdiction to jurisdic-
  tion.  Some jurisdictions do not  allow  the
  exclusion  or  limitation of implied warran-
  ties, so the above exclusion  or  limitation
  may  not  apply to you.   In that event such
  warranties are limited in  duration  to  the
  warranty  period.  No warranties apply after
  that period.

  4. PROGRAM SERVICES
  ___________________

  Defect-related Program services are provided
  for  warranted  Programs  and  for  selected
  other  Programs.    If your reported problem
  can be reproduced in the specified operating
  environment, defect correction  information,
  a  restriction  or  a bypass will be issued.
  Program services are provided only  for  the
  unmodified portion of a current release of a
  Program.   Information regarding how you may
  obtain Program services will be provided  by
  the  party (either IBM or its reseller) from
  whom you acquired the Program.  The duration
  of Program  services  is  specified  in  the
  License Information.

  5. PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS
  _________________________

  If  a  third party claims that a Program IBM
  provides  to  you  infringes  that   party's
  patent   or  copyright,  IBM  will,  at  its
  expense, defend you against that  claim  and
  pay  all costs, damages, and attorney's fees
  that a court finally awards,  provided  that
  you 1) promptly notify IBM in writing of the
  claim and 2) allow IBM to control, and coop-
  erate  with  IBM  in,  the  defense  and any
  related settlement negotiations.  If such  a
  claim  is made or appears likely to be made,
  you agree to permit IBM  to  enable  you  to
  continue  to  use  the Program, or to modify
  it, or replace it with one that is at  least
  functionally  equivalent.  If IBM determines
  that none of these alternatives  is  reason-
  ably  available,  you  agree  to  return the
  Program to IBM  on  IBM's  written  request.
  IBM  will  then give you a credit for a one-
  time  charge  Program,  provided  its  total
  charges have been fully paid.  This is IBM's
  entire obligation to you regarding any claim
  of  infringement.    IBM  has  no obligation
  regarding any claim based on any of the fol-
  lowing: 1) your modification of  a  Program;
  2)  the  combination, operation, or use of a
  Program with any programs,  data,  or  appa-
  ratus  that  IBM  did  not  provide;  or  3)
  infringement by a non-IBM Program.

  6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
  __________________________

  Regardless of the basis on which you may  be
  entitled  to  recover  damages from IBM, for
  any  claim  (including  fundamental  breach,
  negligence,   misrepresentation   or   other
  tort), IBM's liability will only be  for  1)
  payments referred to in the patents and cop-
  yrights  terms  described  above;  2) bodily
  injury (including death), and damage to real
  property and tangible personal property; and
  3) the amount of  any  other  actual  direct
  damages  or  loss,  up to the greater of the
  equivalent of U.S. $100,000  in  your  local
  currency  or  IBM's then generally available
  license charge for the Program.

  IBM WILL NOT  BE  LIABLE  FOR  ANY  SPECIAL,
  INCIDENTAL,  OR  INDIRECT DAMAGES OR FOR ANY
  ECONOMIC  CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES  (INCLUDING
  LOST  PROFITS  OR  SAVINGS), EVEN IF IBM, OR
  ITS RESELLER, HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSI-
  BILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  SOME  JURISDICTIONS
  DO  NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO  THE
  ABOVE  LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
  TO YOU.

  IBM will not be liable for 1)  loss  of,  or
  damage  to,  your  records or data or 2) any
  damages claimed by you based  on  any  third
  party claim.

  This limitation of liability also applies to
  any  developer of a Program supplied to IBM.
  It is the maximum for which we  are  collec-
  tively responsible.

  7. GENERAL
  __________

  You  may terminate your license at any time.
  If you do so, all your license rights to the
  Program are terminated.  You may keep a copy
  of the Program in your archives.    IBM  may
  terminate your license if you fail to comply
  with  the  terms  of this Agreement.  If IBM
  does so, all  your  license  rights  to  the
  Program  are terminated and you must destroy
  all your copies of it.

  You agree  to  comply  with  all  applicable
  export laws and regulations.

  Neither party may bring a legal action under
  this Agreement more than two years after the
  cause of action arose.

  This  Agreement  is  governed by the laws of
  the  country  in  which  you  acquired   the
  Program.
